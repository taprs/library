              long reads (>10 kbp) with very high accuracy (less than 0.01\%
              sequencing error). While several de novo assembly tools are
              available for HiFi reads, there are no comprehensive studies on
              the evaluation of these assemblers. Results We evaluated the
              performance of eleven de novo HiFi assemblers on (i) real data for
              three eukaryotic genomes, (ii) 34 synthetic datasets with
              different ploidy, sequencing coverage levels, heterozygosity rates
              and sequencing error rates, (iii) one real metagenomic dataset,
              and (iv) five synthetic metagenomic datasets with different
              composition abundance and heterozygosity rates. The nine
              assemblers were evaluated using QUAST (Quality Assessment Tool)
              and BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Ortholog). We also
              used several additional criteria, namely, completion rate,
              single-copy completion rate, duplicated completion rate, average
              proportion of largest category, average distance difference,
              quality value, run-time and memory utilization. On complex
              eukaryotic genomes, Hifiasm had a clear advantage over the other
              assemblers in all tested experiments. On synthetic datasets,
              Hifiasm, HiCanu, and HiFlye performed equally well. Shasta and
              Peregrine had good performance across varying ploidy, but required
              high computational resources. On metagenomic datasets,
              Hifiasm-meta demonstrated a clear advantage over other assemblers.
              Conclusion We carried out a comprehensive benchmarking study of
              commonly used assemblers on complex eukaryotic genomes and
              metagenomes. Our study will help the research community to choose
              the most appropriate assembler for their data and identify
              possible improvements in assembly algorithms. \#\#\# Competing

              whole-genome duplication (WGD) without hybridization, yet little
              is known about the genomic structural and functional changes that
              occur in autopolyploids after WGD. Cyclocarya paliurus
              (Juglandaceae) is a natural diploid-autotetraploid species. We
              generated an allele-aware autotetraploid genome, a chimeric
              chromosome-level diploid genome, and whole-genome resequencing
              data for 106 autotetraploid individuals at an average depth of 60
              × per individual, along with 12 diploid individuals at an average
              depth of 90 × per individual. RESULTS: Autotetraploid C. paliurus
              had 64 chromosomes clustered into 16 homologous groups, and the
              majority of homologous chromosomes demonstrated similar chromosome
              length, gene numbers, and expression. The regions of synteny,
              structural variation and nonalignment to the diploid genome
              accounted for 81.3\%, 8.8\% and 9.9\% of the autotetraploid
              genome, respectively. Our analyses identified 20,626 genes
              (69.18\%) with four alleles and 9191 genes (30.82\%) with one,
              two, or three alleles, suggesting post-polyploid allelic loss.
              Genes with allelic loss were found to occur more often in
              proximity to or within structural variations and exhibited a
              marked overlap with transposable elements. Additionally, such
              genes showed a reduced tendency to interact with other genes. We
              also found 102 genes with more than four copies in the
              autotetraploid genome, and their expression levels were
              significantly higher than their diploid counterparts. These genes
              were enriched in enzymes involved in stress response and plant
              defense, potentially contributing to the evolutionary success of
              autotetraploids. Our population genomic analyses suggested a
              single origin of autotetraploids and recent divergence (~ 0.57
              Mya) from diploids, with minimal interploidy admixture.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate the potential for genomic and
              functional reorganization, which may contribute to evolutionary
              success in autotetraploid C. paliurus.",

              sequencing a synthetic intergeneric hybrid (Raphanobrassica,

              while rearrangement was slow. The core and high-frequency genes
              tended to be retained while the specific and low-frequency genes
              tended to be deleted in the hybrid. The large-fragment deletions
              were enriched in the heterochromatin region and probably derived
              from chromosome breaks. The intergeneric translocations were
              primarily of short fragments dependent on homoeology, indicating a
              gene conversion origin. To accelerate genome shuffling, we
              developed an efficient genome editing platform for

              published sources significantly vary. Thus, we aimed to clarify
              the taxonomy and distribution of aquatic Sparganium in that area.
              We supplemented the existing fragmentary genetic and morphological
              data mainly from North America and South Asia with our data from
              East Europe and North Asia. We combined molecular barcoding of the
              nuclear phyC and plastid psbJ-petA DNA regions (382 samples) with
              morphological analysis of herbarium collections (more than 1500
              specimens from 16 herbaria) and numerous natural populations with
              a special focus on hardly accessible Siberian and the Far Eastern
              regions of Russia. We found that aquatic Sparganium is represented
              in North Eurasia by nine species and 14 hybrids. Nine previously
              unknown hybrids are formally described as new nothotaxa. All
              species and hybrids could be reliably discriminated with
              barcoding. We refined the distribution of all taxa in North
              Eurasia, e.g., S. angustifolium, a species avoiding continental
              areas, where it was confused by many authors with mostly
              vegetative specimens of other taxa. In the S. emersum complex in
              addition to recognized earlier widespread S. emersum and eastern
              North American S. chlorocarpum we proved the existence of one more
              distinct lineage – Asian Pacific S. rothertii. We discovered
              different evolutionary lineages within some species (e.g., S.
              glomeratum and S. hyperboreum) causing additional issues in the
              taxa identification. Almost all species cross with each other,
              usually acting both as plastid and pollen donors. Most of the
              hybrids are widespread and abundant. They originate each time when
              the ranges of parental species overlap and suitable habitats are
              available, and rather do not disperse from the centres of origin.
              Hybridization can be a threat to species with narrow ecological
              tolerance. Active gene flow is also evident within species when
              different evolutionary lineages come in contact (e.g., S. emersum,
              S. rothertii, S. glomeratum, S. hyperboreum, S. natans). We
              provide a new taxonomic treatment, which solves many long-standing
              issues in subgenus Xanthosparganium, and a new identification key
              for both species and hybrids occurring in North Eurasia.",

               angiosperm evolution. Recent genomic investigations not only
               indicate that polyploidy is ubiquitous among angiosperms, but
               also suggest several ancient genome-doubling events. These
               include ancient whole genome duplication (WGD) events in basal
               angiosperm lineages, as well as a proposed paleohexaploid event
               that may have occurred close to the eudicot divergence. However,
               there is currently no evidence for WGD in Amborella, the putative
               sister species to other extant angiosperms. The question is no

               ``How many episodes of polyploidy characterize any given

               for large-scale genetic modifications. Many evolutionarily

               evolution. However, this hypothesis is challenged by the observed
               lower speciation and higher extinction rates of recently formed
               polyploids than diploids. Asteraceae includes about 10\% of
               angiosperm species, is thus undoubtedly one of the most
               successful lineages and paleopolyploidization was suggested early
               in this family using a small number of datasets. Here, we used

               Polyloidization plays an important role in plant genome
               evolution, species divergence and crop domestication. We review
               how the pattern of polyploidy within the plant phylogenetic tree
               has engendered hypotheses involving mass extinctions, lag-times
               following polyploidy, and epochs of asexuality. Polyploidization
               has happened repeatedly in plant evolution and, we conclude, is
               important for crop domestication. Once duplicated, the effect of
               purifying selection on any one duplicated gene is relaxed,
               permitting duplicate gene and regulatory element loss
               (fractionation). We review the general topic of fractionation,
               and how some gene categories are retained more than others.
               Several explanations, including neofunctionalization,
               subfunctionalization and gene product dosage balance, have been
               shown to influence gene content over time. For allopolyploids,
               genetic differences between parental lines immediately manifest
               as subgenome dominance in the wide-hybrid, and persist and
               propagate for tens of millions of years. While epigenetic
               modifications are certainly involved in genome dominance, it has
               been difficult to determine which came first, the chromatin marks
               being measured or gene expression. Data support the conclusion
               that genome dominance and heterosis are antagonistic and
               mechanically entangled; both happen immediately in the synthetic
               wide-cross hybrid. Also operating in this hybrid are mechanisms
               of 'paralogue interference'. We present a foundation model to
               explain gene expression and vigour in a wide hybrid/new
               allotetraploid. This Review concludes that some mechanisms
               operate immediately at the wide-hybrid, and other mechanisms
               begin their operations later. Direct interaction of new
               paralogous genes, as measured using high-resolution chromatin
               conformation capture, should inform future research and single
               cell transcriptome sequencing should help achieve specificity

               evidence that angiosperms harbouring self-incompatibility (SI)
               systems are likely to respond to global changes in unique ways
               relative to taxa with other mating systems. In this paper, we
               present an updated database on the prevalence of SI systems
               across angiosperms and examine the relationship between the
               presence of SI and latitude, biomes, life-history traits and
               management conditions to evaluate the potential vulnerability of
               SI taxa to climate change and habitat disturbance. METHODS: We
               performed literature searches to identify studies that employed
               controlled crosses, microscopic analyses and/or genetic data to
               classify taxa as having SI, self-compatibility (SC), partial
               self-compatibility (PSC) or self-sterility (SS). Where described,
               the site of the SI reaction and the presence of dimorphic versus
               monomorphic flowers were also recorded. We then combined this
               database on the distribution of mating systems with information
               about the life span, growth habit, management conditions and
               geographic distribution of taxa. Information about the geographic
               distribution of taxa was obtained from a manually curated version
               of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility database, and
               from vegetation surveys encompassing 9 biomes. We employed
               multinomial logit regression to assess the relationship between
               mating system and life-history traits, management condition,
               latitude and latitude-squared using self-compatible taxa as the
               baseline. Additionally, we employed LOESS regression to examine
               the relationship between the probability of SI and latitude.
               Finally, by summarizing information at the family level, we
               plotted the distribution of SI systems across angiosperms
               including information about the presence of SI or dioecy, the
               inferred reaction site of the SI system when known, as well as
               the proportion of taxa in a family for which information is
               available. KEY RESULTS: We obtained information about the SI
               status of 5686 hermaphroditic taxa, of which 55\% exhibited SC,
               and the remaining 45\% harbour SI, self-sterility (SS), or PSC.
               Highlights of the multinomial logit regression include that taxa
               with PSC have a greater odds of being short- (OR=1.3) or long-
               (OR=1.57) lived perennials relative to SC ones, and that SS/SI
               taxa (pooled) are less likely to be annuals (OR=0.64) and more
               likely to be long-lived perennials (OR=1.32). SS/SI taxa had a
               greater odds of being succulent (OR=2.4) or a tree (OR=2.05), and
               were less likely to be weeds (OR=0.34). Further, we find a
               quadratic relationship between the probability of being SI with
               latitude: SI taxa were more common in the tropics, a finding that
               was further supported by the vegetation surveys which showed
               fewer species with SS/SI in temperate and northern latitudes
               compared to mediterranean and tropical biomes. CONCLUSIONS: We
               conclude that in the short-term habitat fragmentation, pollinator
               loss and temperature increases may negatively impact plants with
               SI systems, particularly long-lived perennial and woody species
               dominant in tropical forests. In the longer term, these and other
               global changes are likely to select for self-compatible or
               partially self-compatible taxa which, due to the apparent
               importance of SI as a driver of plant diversification across the
               angiosperm tree of life, may globally influence plant species

               inbreeding which elevates genome-wide homozygosity and thus
               should also create long ROHs. While ROHs are frequently used to
               understand inbreeding in the context of conservation and
               selective breeding, as well as for consanguinity of populations
               and their demographic history, it remains unclear how ROH
               characteristics are altered by selfing and if this confounds
               expected signatures of inbreeding due to demographic change.
               Using simulations, we study the impact of the mode of
               reproduction and demographic history on ROHs. We apply random
               forests to identify unique characteristics of ROHs, indicative of
               different sources of inbreeding. We pinpoint distinct features of
               ROHs that can be used to better characterize the type of

               neutrality and constant population growth. It is well known that
               the estimation of θ is biased when these assumptions are
               violated. However, the effects of sample size in modulating the
               bias was not well appreciated. We examined this issue in detail
               based on large-scale exome data and robust simulations. Our
               investigation revealed that sample size appreciably influences θ
               estimation and this effect was much higher for constrained
               genomic regions than that of neutral regions. For instance, θ
               estimated for synonymous sites using 512 human exomes was 1.9
               times higher than that obtained using 16 exomes. However, this
               difference was 2.5 times for the nonsynonymous sites of the same
               data. We observed a positive correlation between the rate of
               increase in θ estimates (with respect to the sample size) and the
               magnitude of selection pressure. For example, θ estimated for the
               nonsynonymous sites of highly constrained genes (dN/dS 0.9). The
               results of this study reveal the extent of underestimation owing
               to small sample sizes and thus emphasize the importance of sample
               size in estimating a number of population genomic parameters. Our

               Tajima D, Fu-Li D and those based on the McDonald and Kreitman
               test: Neutrality Index and the fraction of adaptive
               substitutions. For instance, use of 16 exomes produced 2.4 times

               crassipes ramets from 60 locations (193,495 nucleotide sites) and
               118 E. azurea ramets from 53 locations (198,343 nucleotide sites)

               all measures of clonal diversity that we examined. Eichhornia

               widespread disjunct geographical distributions, providing

               disjunct western and eastern ranges of North America (NA).
               Populations of this species are most commonly either monoecious

               test the hypothesis that the western range of this species

               the roles of reproductive system differences and geography in

               ResultsChloroplast haplotyping revealed a single haplotype in
               western NA compared to numerous haplotypes in eastern NA,
               consistent with a genetic bottleneck during westward migration.
               Estimates of genetic diversity in eastern NA populations differed
               significantly between reproductive systems, but this pattern was
               not evident in the western range. Eastern populations could be
               reliably assigned to genetic clusters based on their reproductive
               systems, whereas western populations clustered primarily by
               geographical location.ConclusionsThe sparser distribution of
               aquatic habitats in the drier western range of S. latifolia,
               combined with secondary colonization of this region, probably
               cause the lower genetic diversity and increased differentiation
               among populations, possibly overriding the effects of
               reproductive system evident in the eastern portion of the range.

               In the decades that followed, a number of papers provided
               differing definitions, estimation methods, and interpretations
               beyond Wright's. While this diversity in methods has enabled many
               studies in genetics, it has also introduced confusion regarding
               how to estimate FST from available data. Considering this
               confusion, wide variation in published estimates of FST for pairs
               of HapMap populations is a cause for concern. These estimates
               changed—in some cases more than twofold—when comparing estimates
               from genotyping arrays to those from sequence data. Indeed,
               changes in FST from sequencing data might be expected due to
               population genetic factors affecting rare variants. While rare
               variants do influence the result, we show that this is largely

               of mutation and that assumed an island model of migration. We

               tools to study human genetic variation. Here, I derive explicit
               connections between the two approaches and show that these two
               methods are closely related. F -statistics have a simple
               geometrical interpretation in the context of PCA, and orthogonal
               projections are a key concept to establish this link. I show that
               for any pair of populations, any population that is admixed as
               determined by an F 3 -statistic will lie inside a circle on a PCA
               plot. Furthermore, the F 4 -statistic is closely related to an
               angle measurement, and will be zero if the differences between
               pairs of populations intersect at a right angle in PCA space. I
               illustrate my results on two examples, one of Western Eurasian,
               and one of global human diversity. In both examples, I find that
               the first few PCs are sufficient to approximate most F
               -statistics, and that PCA plots are effective at predicting F
               -statistics. Thus, while F -statistics are commonly understood in
               terms of discrete populations, the geometric perspective
               illustrates that they can be viewed in a framework of populations
               that vary in a more continuous manner. This article is part of

              genetics of both plants and animals, the development of population
              genetic theory of polyploids has seriously lagged behind that of
              diploids. This is unfortunate since the analysis of polyploid
              genetic data-and the interpretation of the results-requires even
              more scrutiny than with diploid data. This is because of several
              polyploidy-specific complications in segregation and genotyping
              such as tetrasomy, double reduction, and missing dosage
              information. Here, we review the theoretical and statistical
              aspects of the population genetics of polyploids. We discuss
              several widely used types of inferences, including genetic
              diversity, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, population differentiation,
              genetic distance, and detecting population structure. For each, we
              point out how the statistical approach, expected result, and
              interpretation differ between different ploidy levels. We also
              discuss for each type of inference what biases may arise from the
              polyploid-specific complications and how these biases can be
              overcome. From our overview, it is clear that the statistical
              toolbox that is available for the analysis of genetic data is
              flexible and still expanding. Modern sequencing techniques will
              soon be able to overcome some of the current limitations to the
              analysis of polyploid data, though the techniques are lagging
              behind those available for diploids. Furthermore, the availability
              of more data may aggravate the biases that can arise, and increase
              the risk of false inferences. Therefore, simulations such as we
              used throughout this review are an important tool to verify the

              undergone ancient WGDs, and today stable polyploids account for a
              substantial portion of both wild and domesticated plant species.
              Despite its centrality in evolution, WGD is a hugely disruptive
              mutation, and we still lack a clear understanding of its fitness
              consequences. Here, we study whether WGD results in greater
              diversity of genomic structural variants (SVs) and how this
              influences evolutionary dynamics in nature. Using a set of
              long-read sequenced samples from the plant genus Cochlearia
              (Brassicaceae), which contains diploids and a recent ploidy series
              up to octoploid, we show that masking of recessive mutations due
              to WGD has led to a substantial and progressive accumulation of
              genic SVs across four ploidy levels. Such SVs likely constitute a
              genetic load and thus reduce the adaptive potential of polyploid
              populations. However, this SV accumulation also provides a rich
              pool of standing genetic variation upon which selection may act in
              novel environments. By constructing a graph-based pangenome for
              Cochlearia , we identify SVs in hundreds of samples and study the
              genomic basis of environmental adaptation. We find putatively
              beneficial SVs involved in pathogen resistance, root development,
              and salt tolerance, many of which are unique to polyploids.
              Finally, we explore the adaptive landscapes of SVs and SNPs,
              identify geographical regions where SVs make novel contributions
              to adaptive variation, and predict that the role of SVs in
              environmental adaptation increases due to rapid climate change.

              technologies, which are starting to provide nearly complete genome
              sequences for population samples, should solve the problem—except
              that characterizing and making sense of non-SNP variation is
              difficult even with perfect sequence data. Here, we analyze 27
              genomes ofArabidopsis thalianain an attempt to address these
              issues, and illustrate what can be learned by analyzing
              whole-genome polymorphism data in an unbiased manner. Estimated
              genome sizes range from 135 to 155 Mb, with differences almost
              entirely due to centromeric and rDNA repeats. The completely
              assembled chromosome arms comprise roughly 120 Mb in all
              accessions, but are full of structural variants, many of which are
              caused by insertions of transposable elements (TEs) and subsequent
              partial deletions of such insertions. Even with only 27
              accessions, a pan-genome coordinate system that includes the
              resulting variation ends up being 40\% larger than the size of any
              one genome. Our analysis reveals an incompletely annotated
              mobile-ome: our ability to predict what is actually moving is
              poor, and we detect several novel TE families. In contrast to
              this, the genic portion, or “gene-ome”, is highly conserved. By
              annotating each genome using accession-specific transcriptome
              data, we find that 13\% of all genes are segregating in our 27
              accessions, but that most of these are transcriptionally silenced.
              Finally, we show that with short-read data we previously massively
              underestimated genetic variation of all kinds, including
              SNPs—mostly in regions where short reads could not be mapped
              reliably, but also where reads were mapped incorrectly. We
              demonstrate that SNP-calling errors can be biased by the choice of
              reference genome, and that RNA-seq and BS-seq results can be
              strongly affected by mapping reads to a reference genome rather
              than to the genome of the assayed individual. In conclusion, while
              whole-genome polymorphism data pose tremendous analytical
              challenges, they will ultimately revolutionize our understanding

              driving phenotypic novelty in plants, often altering the way
              organisms interface with the abiotic environment. Only recently,
              however, have we begun to investigate how polyploidy influences
              interactions of plants with other species, despite the biotic
              niche being predicted as one of the main determinants of polyploid
              establishment. Nevertheless, we lack critical information about
              how polyploidy affects the diversity and composition of the
              microbial taxa that colonize plants, and whether this is
              genotype-dependent and repeatable across natural environments.
              This information is a critical first step toward understanding
              whether the microbiome contributes to polyploid establishment. We
              thus tested the immediate effect of polyploidy on the diversity
              and composition of the bacterial microbiome of the aquatic plant
              Spirodela polyrhiza using four pairs of diploids and synthetic
              autotetraploids. Under controlled conditions, axenic plants were
              inoculated with pond waters collected from 10 field sites across a
              broad environmental gradient. Autotetraploids hosted 4-11 \%
              greater bacterial taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity than their
              diploid progenitors. Polyploidy, along with its interactions with
              the inoculum source and genetic lineage, collectively explained 7
              \% of the total variation in microbiome composition. Furthermore,
              polyploidy broadened the core microbiome, with autotetraploids
              having 15 unique bacterial taxa in addition to the 55 they shared
              with diploids. Our results show that whole genome duplication
              directly leads to novelty in plant microbiome and importantly,
              that the effect is dependent on the genetic ancestry of the
              polyploid and generalizable over many environmental contexts.

               accumulation (MA) on multiple hybrid genotypes within and between

               characterize the role of SVs in shaping the TE landscape. Highly
               contiguous phased assemblies of 127 MA lines revealed that SV
               types like polyploidy, aneuploidy, and loss of heterozygosity
               have large impacts on the TE load. We characterized 18 de novo TE
               insertions, indicating that transposition only has a minor role
               in shaping the TE landscape in MA lines. Because the scarcity of
               TE mobilization in MA lines provided insufficient resolution to
               confidently dissect transposition rate variation in hybrids, we
               adapted an in vivo assay to measure transposition rates in

               transposition rates are not increased by hybridization, but are
               modulated by many genotype-specific factors including initial TE
               load, TE sequence variants, and mitochondrial DNA inheritance.
               Our results show the multiple scales at which TE load is shaped
               in hybrid genomes, being highly impacted by SV dynamics and

              Although molecular and adaptive breeding strategies can buffer the
              effects of climatic stress and improve crop resilience5, these
              approaches require sufficient knowledge of the genes that underlie
              productivity and adaptation6-knowledge that has been limited to a
              small number of well-studied model systems. Here we present the
              assembly and annotation of the large and complex genome of the
              polyploid bioenergy crop switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). Analysis
              of biomass and survival among 732 resequenced genotypes, which
              were grown across 10 common gardens that span 1,800 km of
              latitude, jointly revealed extensive genomic evidence of climate
              adaptation. Climate-gene-biomass associations were abundant but
              varied considerably among deeply diverged gene pools. Furthermore,
              we found that gene flow accelerated climate adaptation during the
              postglacial colonization of northern habitats through
              introgression of alleles from a pre-adapted northern gene pool.
              The polyploid nature of switchgrass also enhanced adaptive
              potential through the fractionation of gene function, as there was
              an increased level of heritable genetic diversity on the
              nondominant subgenome. In addition to investigating patterns of
              climate adaptation, the genome resources and gene-trait
              associations developed here provide breeders with the necessary
              tools to increase switchgrass yield for the sustainable production

              compress such data for sharing. Though there are some specific
              compressors, they lack interoperability. In this study, a SAMtools
              bgzip variant named 7bgzf has been developed, incorporating
              several compression and deflation algorithms other than the widely
              used zlib algorithm. An extensive benchmarking study has been
              carried out with available data compression software. RESULTS: On
              both x64 and ARM machines, igzip performed very rapidly. For high
              compression, using libdeflate on the x64 platform achieved high
              compression with tolerable speed loss. CONCLUSIONS: Based on
              appropriate algorithm selection, the proposed compression method
              performed better than the original bgzip method while maintaining
              interoperability with existing software. Therefore, this software
              is useful for both distribution of genomic sequence archives and

              meiosis is common. The initial stages of allopolyploid formation
              are characterized by a spectrum of saltational genomic and
              regulatory alterations that are responsible for evolutionary

              stages of allopolyploid stabilization. Homoeologous exchanges
              (HEs) have been reported in young allopolyploids from across the
              angiosperms. Although all lineages undergo karyotype change via

              can hence be responsible for speciation and genome stabilization
              events. Additionally, we propose that fixation of duplication -

              genomes which appear to be a mix of autopolyploid and

              Challenges are presented by large eukaryotic genomes and
              heterogeneous data situations. To meet the challenges, several
              streams of evidence must be integrated, from protein homology and
              transcriptome data, as well as information derived from the genome
              itself. The amount and significance of the available evidence from
              transcriptomes and proteomes vary from genome to genome, between
              genes and even along a single gene. User-friendly and accurate
              annotation pipelines that can cope with such data heterogeneity
              are needed. The previously developed annotation pipelines BRAKER1
              and BRAKER2 use RNA-Seq or protein data, respectively, but not
              both. The recently released GeneMark-ETP integrates all three
              types of data and achieves much higher levels of accuracy. We here
              present the BRAKER3 pipeline that builds on GeneMark-ETP and
              AUGUSTUS and further improves accuracy using the TSEBRA combiner.
              BRAKER3 annotates protein-coding genes in eukaryotic genomes using
              both short-read RNA-Seq and a large protein database along with
              statistical models learned iteratively and specifically for the
              target genome. We benchmarked the new pipeline on 11 species under
              controlled conditions on the assumed relatedness of the target
              species to available proteomes. BRAKER3 outperformed BRAKER1 and
              BRAKER2, increasing the average transcript-level F1-score by ∼ 20
              percentage points, most pronounced for species with large and
              complex genomes. BRAKER3 also outperforms MAKER2 and Funannotate.
              For the first time, we provide a Singularity container for the

              first time, including the megabase-scale satellite repeat arrays
              found in many eukaryotic centromeres. The assembly of such
              repetitive regions creates a need for their de novo annotation,
              including patterns of higher order repetition. To annotate tandem
              repeats, methods are required that can be widely applied to
              diverse genome sequences, without prior knowledge of monomer
              sequences. RESULTS: Tandem Repeat Annotation and Structural
              Hierarchy (TRASH) is a tool that identifies and maps tandem
              repeats in nucleotide sequence, without prior knowledge of repeat
              composition. TRASH analyses a fasta assembly file, identifies
              regions occupied by repeats and then precisely maps them and their
              higher order structures. To demonstrate the applicability and
              scalability of TRASH for centromere research, we apply our method
              to the recently published Col-CEN genome of Arabidopsis thaliana

               alignment techniques is that the left- and right-most positions
               of the input sequences are relevant to the alignment. However,
               the position where a sequence starts or ends can be totally
               arbitrary due to a number of reasons: arbitrariness in the
               linearisation (sequencing) of a circular molecular structure; or
               inconsistencies introduced into sequence databases due to
               different linearisation standards. These scenarios are relevant,
               for instance, in the process of multiple sequence alignment of
               mitochondrial DNA, viroid, viral or other genomes, which have a
               circular molecular structure. A solution for these
               inconsistencies would be to identify a suitable rotation (cyclic
               shift) for each sequence; these refined sequences may in turn
               lead to improved multiple sequence alignments using the preferred
               multiple sequence alignment program. We present MARS, a new
               heuristic method for improving Multiple circular sequence
               Alignment using Refined Sequences. MARS was implemented in the
               C++ programming language as a program to compute the rotations
               (cyclic shifts) required to best align a set of input sequences.
               Experimental results, using real and synthetic data, show that
               MARS improves the alignments, with respect to standard genetic
               measures and the inferred maximum-likelihood-based phylogenies,
               and outperforms state-of-the-art methods both in terms of
               accuracy and efficiency. Our results show, among others, that the
               average pairwise distance in the multiple sequence alignment of a
               dataset of widely-studied mitochondrial DNA sequences is reduced
               by around 5\% when MARS is applied before a multiple sequence
               alignment is performed. Analysing multiple sequences
               simultaneously is fundamental in biological research and multiple
               sequence alignment has been found to be a popular method for this
               task. Conventional alignment techniques cannot be used
               effectively when the position where sequences start is arbitrary.
               We present here a method, which can be used in conjunction with
               any multiple sequence alignment program, to address this problem

              Here, we present QUAST-a quality assessment tool for evaluating

              QUAST can evaluate assemblies both with a reference genome, as
              well as without a reference. QUAST produces many reports, summary

              publications. In this study, we used QUAST to compare several

               the description of Ranunculus schmalhausenii (Batrachium
               dichotomum), probably the most common species in the area, its
               taxonomic status and identity have been unclear and differently
               implied. In the majority of treatments, individuals of R.
               schmalhausenii were ascribed to R. peltatus but sometimes also to
               the other morphologically similar, heterophyllous taxa. Based on
               detailed morphological study combined with geographical,
               ecological and biological evaluation the separate species status
               of this taxon was finally evidenced. The additive ITS
               polymorphism pattern of R. schmalhausenii confirmed its
               hybridogenous origin, however identification of the parental
               species was impeded by the heterogeneous character of the
               polymorphism detected. Genetic variation expressed by R.
               schmalhausenii samples may provide evidence of its multiple
               origin and suggests sexual reproduction of the taxon. Analysis of
               a sequence variation of two noncoding cpDNA regions, namely
               psbE-petL and rpl32-trnL, showed that individuals of R.
               schmalhausenii inherited cpDNA from two lineages of Batrachium,
               indicating that this taxon was created at least in two separate
               hybridization events. Ranunculus schmalhausenii may have
               originated from sexual ancestral species as multiple created
               hybrids which have been stabilized by polyploidisation. Genetic
               structure of R. schmalhausenii is somehow similar to also
               hybridogenous R. penicillatus. In this study, a detailed
               morphological, geographical, ecological, and biological
               description of R. schmalhausenii was presented and the
               differences between this species and similar taxa were outlined.
               The name was lectotypified and its synonymy was provided. In
               contrast to many other heterophyllous species of Ranunculus
               section Batrachium, R. schmalhausenii occurs mainly in young,
               postglacial landscapes of Fennoscandia, prefering deep and clear
               waters with current or wave action and a hard bottom, which
               perfectly corresponds with a relict, postglacial nature of the
               species. The species probably presents an example of rapid hybrid
               speciation (less than 10 000 years) in postglacial environment of
               North Europe and may be considered as endemic to Fennoscandia.
               Moreover, R. schmalhausenii, as a weak competitor and pollution
               sensitive taxon, can be regarded as an indicator of clean waters.

              dysfunction and recombination patterns and has thus been proposed
              as a major driver of diversification in all branches of the tree
              of life, including flowering plants. In this study we used the
              genus Linum (flax species) to evaluate the effects of chromosomal
              evolution on diversification rates and on traits that are
              important for sexual reproduction. Linum is a useful study group
              because it has considerable reproductive polymorphism
              (heterostyly) and chromosomal variation (n = 6-36) and a complex
              pattern of biogeographical distribution. METHODS: We tested
              several traditional hypotheses of chromosomal evolution. We
              analysed changes in chromosome number across the phylogenetic tree
              (ChromEvol model) in combination with diversification rates
              (ChromoSSE model), biogeographical distribution, heterostyly and
              habit (ChromePlus model). KEY RESULTS: Chromosome number evolved
              across the Linum phylogeny from an estimated ancestral chromosome
              number of n = 9. While there were few apparent incidences of
              cladogenesis through chromosome evolution, we inferred up to five
              chromosomal speciation events. Chromosome evolution was not
              related to heterostyly but did show significant relationships with
              habit and geographical range. Polyploidy was negatively correlated
              with perennial habit, as expected from the relative commonness of
              perennial woodiness and absence of perennial clonality in the
              genus. The colonization of new areas was linked to genome
              rearrangements (polyploidy and dysploidy), which could be
              associated with speciation events during the colonization process.
              CONCLUSIONS: Chromosome evolution is a key trait in some clades of
              the Linum phylogeny. Chromosome evolution directly impacts
              speciation and indirectly influences biogeographical processes and
              important plant traits.",

              Restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing is a recent
              technique based on the characterization of genomic regions
              flanking restriction sites. One of its potential drawbacks is the
              presence of polymorphism within the restriction site, which makes

              variation estimated from RAD markers, we first mathematically
              derived measures of the effect of ADO on allele frequencies as a
              function of different parameters within a single population. We

              However, the impact of whole-genome duplication depends on the
              mode of formation: doubling within a single lineage
              (autopolyploidy) versus doubling after hybridization between two
              different lineages (allopolyploidy). Researchers have historically
              treated these two scenarios as completely separate cases based on
              patterns of chromosome pairing, but these cases represent ideals
              on a continuum of chromosomal interactions among duplicated

              demands quantitative inferences of demographic history and rates

              thousands of genes and up to 200 taxa with respect to likelihood
              maximization, tree topology, and computational speed. For

  abstract = "Phylogenetics is nowadays at the center of numerous studies in
              many fields, ranging from comparative genomics to molecular
              epidemiology. However, phylogenetic analysis workflows are usually
              complex and difficult to implement, as they are often composed of
              many small, reccuring, but important data manipulations steps.
              Among these, we can find file reformatting, sequence renaming,
              tree re-rooting, tree comparison, bootstrap support computation,
              etc. These are often performed by custom scripts or by several
              heterogeneous tools, which may be error prone, uneasy to maintain
              and produce results that are challenging to reproduce. For all
              these reasons, the development and reuse of phylogenetic workflows
              is often a complex task. We identified many operations that are
              part of most phylogenetic analyses, and implemented them in a
              toolkit called Gotree/Goalign. The Gotree/Goalign toolkit
              implements more than 120 user-friendly commands and an API
              dedicated to multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree
              manipulations. It is developed in Go, which makes executables
              easily installable, integrable in workflow environments, and
              parallelizable when possible. Moreover, Go is a compiled language,
              which accelerates computations compared to interpreted languages.
              This toolkit is freely available on most platforms (Linux, MacOS
              and Windows) and most architectures (amd64, i386) on GitHub at

               used Allium to evaluate: (1) the relationship between
               intraspecific polyploid frequency and species diversification
               rate; and (2) whether this process is associated with habitat
               and/or trait shifts. Using eight plastid and nuclear ribosomal
               markers, we built a phylogeny of 448 Allium species, representing
               46\% of the total. We quantified intraspecific ploidy diversity,
               heterogeneity in diversification rates and their relationship
               along the phylogeny using trait-dependent diversification models.
               Finally, we evaluated the association between polyploidisation
               and habitat or trait shifts. We detected high ploidy diversity in
               Allium and a polyploidy-related diversification rate shift with a
               probability of 95\% in East Asia. Allium lineages with high

               frequencies. Shifts in speciation rates were strongly correlated
               with habitat shifts linked to particular soil conditions; 81.7\%
               of edaphic variation could be explained by polyploidisation. Our

               relationships and evolutionary history of the family have not

               78 genes and updated the historical biogeography based on the
               phylogenomic tree. Our results divide the Alismataceae into three
               major clades with robust support values; one clade comprises the
               former Limnocharitaceae, and the second clade includes the mainly
               temperate genera Alisma, Baldellia, Damasonium and Luronium, and
               the monotypic African genus Burnatia as a sister of the temperate
               genera. The remaining genera are either tropical or have some

               history of populations has been a major research goal in genetics
               for decades. To that end, numerous statistical tests have been
               developed to detect deviations between expected and observed
               frequency spectra, e.g., Tajima's D, Fu and Li's F and D tests,
               and Fay and Wu's H. Recently, Achaz developed a general framework
               to generate tests that detect deviations in the frequency
               spectrum. In a further development, we argue that the results of
               these tests should be as independent on the sample size as
               possible and propose a scale-free form for them. Furthermore,
               using the same framework as that of Achaz, we develop a new
               family of neutrality tests based on the frequency spectrum that
               are optimal against a chosen alternative evolutionary scenario.
               These tests maximize the power to reject the standard neutral
               model and are scalable with the sample size. Optimal tests are
               derived for several alternative evolutionary scenarios, including
               demographic processes (population bottleneck, expansion,
               contraction) and selective sweeps. Within the same framework, we
               also derive an optimal general test given a generic evolutionary
               scenario as a null model. All formulas are relatively simple and
               can be computed very fast, making it feasible to apply them to
               genome-wide sequence data. A simulation study showed that,
               generally, the tests proposed are more consistently powerful than
               standard tests like Tajima's D. We further illustrate the method

               21 and 22 (SAACs) share large homologous regions, including
               ribosomal DNA repeats and extended segmental duplications1,2.
               Although the resolution of these regions in the first complete
               assembly of a human genome—the Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium’s
               CHM13 assembly (T2T-CHM13)—provided a model of their homology3,
               it remained unclear whether these patterns were ancestral or
               maintained by ongoing recombination exchange. Here we show that
               acrocentric chromosomes contain pseudo-homologous regions (PHRs)
               indicative of recombination between non-homologous sequences.
               Utilizing an all-to-all comparison of the human pangenome from
               the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium4 (HPRC), we find that
               contigs from all of the SAACs form a community. A variation
               graph5 constructed from centromere-spanning acrocentric contigs
               indicates the presence of regions in which most contigs appear
               nearly identical between heterologous acrocentric chromosomes in
               T2T-CHM13. Except on chromosome 15, we observe faster decay of
               linkage disequilibrium in the pseudo-homologous regions than in
               the corresponding short and long arms, indicating higher rates of
               recombination6,7. The pseudo-homologous regions include sequences
               that have previously been shown to lie at the breakpoint of
               Robertsonian translocations8, and their arrangement is compatible
               with crossover in inverted duplications on chromosomes 13, 14 and
               21. The ubiquity of signals of recombination between heterologous
               acrocentric chromosomes seen in the HPRC draft pangenome suggests
               that these shared sequences form the basis for recurrent
               Robertsonian translocations, providing sequence and
               population-based confirmation of hypotheses first developed from
               cytogenetic studies 50 years ago9. Comparisons within the human
               pangenome establish that homologous regions on short arms of
               heterologous human acrocentric chromosomes actively recombine,
               leading to the high rate of Robertsonian translocation

              perform a statistical correction for population stratification.
              One popular technique for estimation of ancestry is the
              model-based approach embodied by the widely applied program
              structure. Another approach, implemented in the program
              EIGENSTRAT, relies on Principal Component Analysis rather than
              model-based estimation and does not directly deliver admixture
              fractions. EIGENSTRAT has gained in popularity in part owing to
              its remarkable speed in comparison to structure. We present a new
              algorithm and a program, ADMIXTURE, for model-based estimation of
              ancestry in unrelated individuals. ADMIXTURE adopts the likelihood
              model embedded in structure. However, ADMIXTURE runs considerably
              faster, solving problems in minutes that take structure hours. In
              many of our experiments, we have found that ADMIXTURE is almost as
              fast as EIGENSTRAT. The runtime improvements of ADMIXTURE rely on
              a fast block relaxation scheme using sequential quadratic
              programming for block updates, coupled with a novel quasi-Newton
              acceleration of convergence. Our algorithm also runs faster and
              with greater accuracy than the implementation of an
              Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm incorporated in the
              program FRAPPE. Our simulations show that ADMIXTURE's maximum
              likelihood estimates of the underlying admixture coefficients and
              ancestral allele frequencies are as accurate as structure's
              Bayesian estimates. On real-world data sets, ADMIXTURE's estimates
              are directly comparable to those from structure and EIGENSTRAT.
              Taken together, our results show that ADMIXTURE's computational
              speed opens up the possibility of using a much larger set of
              markers in model-based ancestry estimation and that its estimates
              are suitable for use in correcting for population stratification
              in association studies.",

              missing nucleotides in their output. A novel method of estimating
              π from data sets containing missing data - pixy - has also
              recently been proposed. In this study, the pixy estimator, πpixy ,

              estimators were tested both on sequences simulated in fastsimcoal

              insertion of missing nucleotides. Weighted nucleotide diversity
              performed better in all pairwise comparisons. It was characterized
              by a smaller error and a narrower distribution of the results.
              πpixy tends to overestimate the nucleotide diversity when both the
              proportion of missing data and the level of variation is low. Of
              the two estimators, only πW estimated the true nucleotide

               is the engine for the graph clustering algorithm called the MCL
               algorithm. The MCL process takes a stochastic matrix as input,
               and then alternates expansion and inflation, each step defining a
               stochastic matrix in terms of the previous one. Expansion
               corresponds with taking the kth power of a stochastic matrix,
               where $k\in\N$. Inflation corresponds with a parametrized
               operator $\Gamma_r$, $r\geq 0$, that maps the set of (column)
               stochastic matrices onto itself. The image $\Gamma_r M$ is
               obtained by raising each entry in M to the rth power and
               rescaling each column to have sum 1 again. In practice the
               process converges very fast towards a limit that is invariant
               under both matrix multiplication and inflation, with quadratic
               convergence around the limit points. The heuristic behind the
               process is its expected behavior for (Markov) graphs possessing
               cluster structure. The process is typically applied to the matrix
               of random walks on a given graph G, and the connected components
               of (the graph associated with) the process limit generically
               allow a clustering interpretation of G. The limit is in general
               extremely sparse and iterands are sparse in a weighted sense,
               implying that the MCL algorithm is very fast and highly scalable.
               Several mathematical properties of the MCL process are
               established. Most notably, the process (and algorithm) iterands
               posses structural properties generalizing the mapping from
               process limits onto clusterings. The inflation operator
               $\Gamma_r$ maps the class of matrices that are diagonally similar
               to a symmetric matrix onto itself. The phrase diagonally positive
               semi-definite (dpsd) is used for matrices that are diagonally
               similar to a positive semi-definite matrix. For $r\in\N$ and for
               M a stochastic dpsd matrix, the image $\Gamma_r M$ is again dpsd.
               Determinantal inequalities satisfied by a dpsd matrix M imply a
               natural ordering among the diagonal elements of M, generalizing
               the mapping of process limits onto clusterings. The spectrum of
               $\Gamma_{\infty} M$ is of the form $\{0^{n-k}, 1^k\}$, where k is
               the number of endclasses of the ordering associated with M, and n
               is the dimension of M. This attests to the uncoupling effect of
               the inflation operator.",

              variation lie not only in the acquisition of extra gene dosages,
              but also in the genomic changes that occur after divergent genomes
              unite. Genomic changes (deletions, duplications, and
              translocations) have been detected in both recently formed natural
              polyploids and resynthesized polyploids. In resynthesized Brassica
              napus allopolyploids, there is evidence that many genetic changes
              are the consequence of homoeologous recombination. Homoeologous
              recombination can generate novel gene combinations and phenotypes,
              but may also destabilize the karyotype and lead to aberrant
              meiotic behavior and reduced fertility. Thus, natural selection
              plays a role in the establishment and maintenance of fertile
              natural allopolyploids that have stabilized chromosome inheritance
              and a few advantageous chromosomal rearrangements. We discuss the
              evidence for genome rearrangements that result from homoeologous
              recombination in resynthesized B. napus and how these observations
              may inform phenomena such as chromosome replacement, aneuploidy,
              non-reciprocal translocations and gene conversion seen in other
              polyploids.",

               in allopolyploids. In this review, we examine whether strong
               evidence has accumulated for the presence and activity of pairing
               control genes in different allopolyploid species that are
               entirely bivalent forming and that display a strict disomic
               inheritance. We show that very good evidence has been adduced in
               Triticum species, Avena sativa, Festuca arundinacea, Brassica
               napus, Gossypium hirsutum, and G. barbadense, and in
               amphidiploids related to the diploid species Lolium perenne, L.

               Nicotiana, and Coffea, which have received far less attention

               control different processes operating throughout the premeiotic
               interphase and the meiotic prophase, little is known about their
               precise mode of action. We present three hypotheses that have
               been proposed to explain the origin and evolution of pairing
               control genes; none of them has been supported by direct
               evidence, and the origin of most pairing suppressors is still
               unknown. Accordingly, the study of pairing control genes is still

               test for organismal admixture (hybridization, or introgression)
               which incorporates single nucleotide polymorphism data with
               allelic patterns ABBA and BABA, has seen considerable use. This
               statistic seeks to discern significant deviation from either a
               given species tree assumption, or from the balanced incomplete
               lineage sorting that could otherwise defy this species tree.
               However, while the D-statistic can successfully discriminate
               admixture from incomplete lineage sorting, it is not a simple
               matter to determine the directionality of admixture using only
               four-leaf tree models. As such, methods have been developed that
               use 5 leaves to evaluate admixture. Among these, the DFOIL
               method, which tests allelic patterns on the “symmetric” tree S =
               (((1,2),(3,4)),5), succeeds in finding admixture direction for
               many five-taxon examples. However, DFOIL does not make full use
               of all symmetry, nor can DFOIL function properly when ancient
               samples are included because of the reliance on singleton
               patterns (such as BAAAA and ABAAA). Here, we take inspiration
               from DFOIL to develop a new and completely general family of
               five-leaf admixture tests, dubbed Δ-statistics, that can either
               incorporate or exclude the singleton allelic patterns depending
               on individual taxon and age sampling choices. We describe two new
               shapes that are also fully testable, namely the “asymmetric” tree
               A = ((((1,2),3),4),5) and the “quasisymmetric” tree Q =
               (((1,2),3),(4,5)), which can considerably supplement the
               “symmetric“ S = (((1,2),(3,4)),5) model used by DFOIL. We
               demonstrate the consistency of Δ-statistics under various
               simulated scenarios, and provide empirical examples using data
               from black, brown and polar bears, the latter also including two
               ancient polar bear samples from previous studies. Recently DFOIL
               and one of these ancient samples was used to argue for a dominant
               polar bear → brown bear introgression direction. However, we
               find, using both this ancient polar bear and our own, that by far
               the strongest signal using both DFOIL and Δ-statistics on tree S
               is actually bidirectional gene flow of indistinguishable
               direction. Further experiments on trees A and Q instead highlight
               what were likely two phases of admixture: one with stronger brown
               bear → polar bear introgression in ancient times, and a more
               recent phase with predominant polar bear → brown bear
               directionality. Code and documentation available at

               phylogeography of the various taxonomic units of the A. lyrata
               complex. We demonstrate the existence of two major gene pools in
               Central Europe and Northern America. These two major gene pools
               are constructed from different taxonomic units. We also confirmed
               that A. kamchatica is the allotetraploid hybrid between A. lyrata
               and A. halleri, occupying the amphi-Beringian area in Eastern
               Asia and Northern America. This species closes the large
               distribution gap of the various other A. lyrata segregates.
               Furthermore, we revealed a threefold independent allopolyploid
               origin of this hybrid species in Japan, China, and Kamchatka.
               Unglaciated parts of the Eastern Austrian Alps and arctic
               Eurasia, including Beringia, served as major glacial refugia of
               the Eurasian A. lyrata lineage, whereas A. halleri and its
               various subspecies probably survived in refuges in Central Europe
               and Eastern Asia with a large distribution gap in between. The
               North American A. lyrata lineage probably survived the glaciation
               in the southeast of North America. The dramatic climatic changes
               during glaciation and deglaciation cycles promoted not only
               secondary contact and formation of the allopolyploid hybrid A.
               kamchatica, but also provided the environment that allowed this
               species to fill a large geographic gap separating the two
               genetically different A. lyrata lineages from Eurasia and North
               America. With our example focusing on the evolutionary history of
               the A. lyrata species complex, we add substantial information to
               a broad evolutionary framework for future investigations within
               this emerging model system in molecular and evolutionary biology.",

               a traditional bifurcating species tree and identify widespread
               shared polymorphisms between species. The notion of species as
               reproductively isolated units related through a bifurcating tree
               implies that gene trees should generally agree with the species
               tree and that sister taxa should not share polymorphisms unless
               they diverged recently and should be equally closely related to
               outgroups. It is now possible to evaluate this model
               systematically. We sequenced multiple individuals from 27
               described taxa representing the entire Arabidopsis genus. Cluster
               analysis identified seven groups, corresponding to described
               species that capture the structure of the genus. However, at the
               level of gene trees, only the separation of Arabidopsis thaliana
               from the remaining species was universally supported, and,
               overall, the amount of shared polymorphism demonstrated that
               reproductive isolation was considerably more recent than the
               estimated divergence times. We uncovered multiple cases of past
               gene flow that contradict a bifurcating species tree. Finally, we
               showed that the pattern of divergence differs between gene
               ontologies, suggesting a role for selection.",

  abstract  = "Reliable detection of genome variations, especially insertions
               and deletions (indels), from single sample DNA sequencing data
               remains challenging, partially due to the inherent uncertainty
               involved in aligning sequencing reads to the reference genome. In
               practice a variety of ad hoc quality filtering methods are
               employed to produce more reliable lists of putative variants, but
               the resulting lists typically still include numerous false
               positives. Thus it would be desirable to be able to rigorously
               evaluate the degree to which each putative variant is supported
               by the data. Unfortunately, users who wish to do this, e.g. for
               the purpose of prioritizing validation experiments, have been
               faced with limited options. Here we present EAGLE, a method for
               evaluating the degree to which sequencing data supports a given
               candidate genome variant. EAGLE incorporates candidate variants
               into explicit hypotheses about the individual’s genome, and then
               computes the probability of the observed data (the sequencing
               reads) under each hypothesis. In comparison with methods which
               rely heavily on a particular alignment of the reads to the
               reference genome, EAGLE readily accounts for uncertainties that
               may arise from multi-mapping or local misalignment and uses the
               entire length of each read. We compared the scores assigned by
               several well-known variant callers to EAGLE for the task of
               ranking true putative variants on both simulated data and real
               genome sequencing based benchmarks. For indels, EAGLE obtained
               marked improvement on simulated data and a whole genome
               sequencing benchmark, and modest but statistically significant
               improvement on an exome sequencing benchmark. EAGLE ranked true
               variants higher than the scores reported by the callers and can
               used to improve specificity in variant calling. EAGLE is freely

  pages    = "1875--1890",
  abstract = "Populations of the tristylous, annual Eichhornia paniculata are
              markedly differentiated with respect to frequency of mating types.
              This variation is associated with evolutionary changes in mating
              system, from predominant outcrossing to high self-fertilization.
              To assess the potential influence of genetic drift acting on this
              variation, we estimated effective population size in 10
              populations from northeastern Brazil using genetic and demographic
              methods. Effective size (Ne) was inferred from temporal changes in
              allele frequency at two to eight isozyme loci and also calculated
              using five demographic variables: 1) the number of flowering
              individuals (N); 2) temporal fluctuations in N; 3) variance in
              flower number; 4) frequency of mating types; and 5) selfing rate.
              Average Ne based on isozyme data was 15.8, range 3.4-70.6, and
              represented a fraction (mean Ne/N = 0.106) of the census number of
              individuals (mean N = 762.8; range: 30.5-5,040). Temporal
              variation in N and variance in flower number each reduced Ne to
              about a half of N, whereas mating type frequencies and selfing
              rate caused only small reductions in Ne relative to N. All
              estimates of Ne based on demographic variables were considerably
              larger than those obtained from genetic data. The two kinds of
              estimates were in general agreement, however, when all demographic
              variables were combined into a single measure. Monte Carlo
              simulations indicated that effective size must be fewer than about
              40 for drift to overcome the frequency-dependent selection that
              maintains the polymorphism for mating type. Applying the average
              Ne/N value to 167 populations censused in northeastern Brazil
              indicated that 72\% had effective sizes below this number. This
              suggests that genetic drift is likely to play a dominant role in
              natural populations of E. paniculata.",

              features related to these tasks. This was the motivation for
              developing a new program, SeqState. SeqState locates regions that
              remain to be sequenced in phylogenetic DNA datasets, evaluates
              user-provided primers and selects primers best suited to fill gaps
              in the sequences. If the primers provided by the user are
              unsuitable, new primers are designed. Primers can be loaded from a
              primer database, be supplied as part of the alignment or be
              entered manually. The position of internal primers is
              automatically localised in the loaded data file. Primers can be
              edited, and changes and new primers can be saved to the database.
              Primer sheets allow the user to view internal dimers, complements
              to a second primer, mismatches to all loaded sequences, and other
              primer characteristics. Calculation of various sequence statistics
              can be requested for the whole dataset or parts thereof (character
              sets), with standard errors estimated by bootstrapping.
              Insertion-deletion events can be evaluated statistically and

               linked with particular taxonomic groups (flowering plants,
               ferns), northern latitudes and extreme environments, and life
               histories such as perenniality, asexuality and
               self-fertilization. Here we review the current state of evidence
               for these patterns and their interpretations. Our understanding
               of the incidence of polyploidy in plants is still in flux due to
               a progression of advances in cytogenetics, flow cytometry,
               phylogenetics and genomics. We find polyploidy to be highly
               heterogeneous among plant groups and estimates of intraspecific
               variation and hybrid forms are increasing with high throughput
               analyses. Surprisingly, many accepted trends between polyploidy
               and geography, mating system, and comparative rates of species
               diversification have become less strong or conflicting with the
               development of new procedures, in particular with phylogenetic
               approaches. Our review suggests that while some patterns remain
               strong, many are not universal, suggesting there may be no
               unified explanation for the success of polyploids in plants.",

              duplicated genes, and show that the pattern of loss differs among
              the three species at 20\% of all loci. For example, several
              transcription factor genes, including STE12, TEC1, TUP1 and MCM1,
              are single-copy in S. cerevisiae but are retained in duplicate in
              S. castellii and C. glabrata. At many loci, different species have
              lost different members of a duplicated gene pair, so that 4-7\% of
              single-copy genes compared between any two species are not
              orthologues. This pattern of gene loss provides strong evidence
              for speciation through a version of the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller
              mechanism, in which the loss of alternative copies of duplicated

              as a by-product of evolutionary divergence. Divergent resolution
              of duplicate genes, a special case of Dobzhansky-Muller
              incompatibilities, is one mechanism by which hybrid
              incompatibility can evolve. Following whole-genome duplication,
              loss of gene copies could possibly increase the opportunity for
              divergent resolution and, hence, the evolution of hybrid
              incompatibilities. However, divergent resolution can take place
              only when populations are isolated in allopatry; genes lost within
              a species cannot contribute to future speciation. Furthermore,
              nearly complete allopatry is necessary for passive divergent
              resolution. Using mathematical models, we demonstrate that these

  abstract = "Background: Seagrasses (Alismatales) are the only fully marine
              angiosperms. Zostera marina (eelgrass) plays a crucial role in the
              functioning of coastal marine ecosystems and global carbon
              sequestration. It is the most widely studied seagrass and has
              become a marine model system for exploring adaptation under rapid
              climate change. The original draft genome (v.1.0) of the seagrass
              Z. marina (L.) was based on a combination of Illumina mate-pair
              libraries and fosmid-ends. A total of 25.55 Gb of Illumina and
              0.14 Gb of Sanger sequence was obtained representing 47.7× genomic
              coverage. The assembly resulted in ~2000 unordered scaffolds (L50
              of 486 Kb), a final genome assembly size of 203MB, 20,450 protein
              coding genes and 63\% TE content. Here, we present an upgraded
              chromosome-scale genome assembly and compare v.1.0 and the new
              v.3.1, reconfirming previous results from Olsen et al. (2016), as
              well as pointing out new findings. Methods: The same high
              molecular weight DNA used in the original sequencing of the
              Finnish clone was used. A high-quality reference genome was
              assembled with the MECAT assembly pipeline combining PacBio
              long-read sequencing and Hi-C scaffolding. Results: In total,
              75.97 Gb PacBio data was produced. The final assembly comprises
              six pseudo-chromosomes and 304 unanchored scaffolds with a total
              length of 260.5Mb and an N50 of 34.6 MB, showing high contiguity
              and few gaps (~0.5\%). 21,483 protein-encoding genes are annotated
              in this assembly, of which 20,665 (96.2\%) obtained at least one
              functional assignment based on similarity to known proteins.
              Conclusions: As an important marine angiosperm, the improved Z.
              marina genome assembly will further assist evolutionary,
              ecological, and comparative genomics at the chromosome level. The
              new genome assembly will further our understanding into the

              included 95 samples (89 Alismatales species) covering four genomes
              and 91 transcriptomes (59 generated in this study). To provide a
              basis for investigating adaptations, we assessed phylogenetic
              conflict and whole-genome duplication (WGD) events in Alismatales.
              We recovered a relationship for the three main clades in
              Alismatales as (Tofieldiaceae, Araceae) + core Alismatids. We also
              found phylogenetic conflict among the three main clades that was
              best explained by incomplete lineage sorting and introgression.
              Overall, we identified 18 putative WGD events across Alismatales.
              One of them occurred at the most recent common ancestor of core
              Alismatids, and three occurred at seagrass lineages. We also found

              marine adaptation. For example, several light- or ethylene-related
              genes were lost in the seagrass Zosteraceae, but are present in
              other seagrasses and freshwater species. Stomata-related genes
              were lost in both submersed freshwater species and seagrasses.
              Nicotianamine synthase genes, which are important in iron intake,
              expanded in both submersed freshwater species and seagrasses. Our

              perennial herb Arabidopsis lyrata ssp. petraea from the
              northernmost parts of its distribution range on Iceland to that
              previously documented in Scandinavia. Leaf tissue and soil were
              sampled from ten Icelandic populations of A. lyrata. Seedlings
              were grown from soil samples, and tissue from above-ground and
              seed bank individuals were genotyped with 21 microsatellite
              markers. Seed bank density in Icelandic populations was low but
              not significantly different from that observed in Norwegian
              populations. While within-population genetic diversity was
              relatively high on Iceland (H(E) = 0.35), among-population
              differentiation was low (F(ST) = 0.10) compared to Norwegian and
              Swedish populations. Population differentiation was positively
              associated with geographical distance in both Iceland and
              Scandinavia, but the strength of this relationship varied between
              regions. Although topography and a larger distribution range may
              explain the higher differentiation between mountainous Norwegian
              relative to lowland populations in Sweden, these factors cannot
              explain the lower differentiation in Icelandic compared to Swedish
              populations. We propose that low genetic differentiation among
              Icelandic populations is not caused by differences in
              connectivity, but is rather due to large historical effective
              population sizes. Thus, rather than contemporary processes,
              historical factors such as survival of Icelandic lineages in
              northern refugia during the last glacial period may have
              contributed to the observed pattern.",

              environments adapt and diverge simultaneously, and both processes
              leave footprints in their genetic diversity. Arabidopsis lyrata is
              an excellent species for studying these processes. Pairs of
              populations and subspecies of A. lyrata represent different stages
              of divergence. These populations are also known to be locally
              adapted and display various stages of emerging reproductive
              isolation. • Methods: We used nucleotide diversity data from 19
              loci to estimate divergence times and levels of diversity among
              nine A. lyrata populations. Traditional distance-based methods and
              model-based clustering analysis were used to supplement pairwise
              coalescence-based analysis of divergence. • Key results: Estimated
              divergence times varied from 130000 generations between North
              American and European subspecies to 39000 generations between
              central European and Scandinavian populations. In concordance with
              previous studies, the highest level of diversity was found in
              Central Europe and the lowest in North America and a diverged
              Russian Karhumäki population. Local adaptation among Northern and
              central European populations has emerged during the last 39000
              generations. Populations that are reproductively isolated by
              prezygotic mechanisms have been separated for a longer time period
              of ∼70000 generations but still have shared nucleotide
              polymorphism. • Conclusions: In A. lyrata, reproductively isolated
              populations started to diverge ∼70000 generations ago and more
              closely related, locally adapted populations have been separate
              lineages for ∼39000 generations. However, based on the posterior
              distribution of divergence times, the processes leading to
              reproductive isolation and local adaptation are likely to
              temporally coincide.",

              transition to selfing from that of North American A. lyrata.
              Moreover, using both A. lyrata genomes we detect segregating

              from A. lyrata. This suggests that transition to

               highly underrepresented in contemporary biosystematic studies. Of
               them, the genus Callitriche is particularly interesting because
               of such evolutionary features as wide variation in chromosome
               numbers and pollination systems. However, taxonomic difficulties
               have prevented broader investigation of this genus. In this study
               we applied flow cytometry to Callitriche for the first time in
               order to gain an insight into evolutionary processes and genome
               size differentiation in the genus. Flow cytometry complemented by
               confirmation of chromosome counts was applied to an extensive
               dataset of 1077 Callitriche individuals from 495 localities in 11
               European countries and the USA. Genome size was determined for 12
               taxa. The results suggest that many important processes have
               interacted in the evolution of the genus, including
               polyploidization and hybridization. Incongruence between genome
               size and ploidy level, intraspecific variation in genome size,
               formation of autotriploid and hybridization between species with
               different pollination systems were also detected. Hybridization
               takes place particularly in the diploid-tetraploid complex C.
               cophocarpa-C. platycarpa, for which the triploid hybrids were
               frequently recorded in the area of co-occurrence of its parents.
               A hitherto unknown hybrid (probably C. hamulata × C. cophocarpa)
               with a unique chromosome number was discovered in the Czech
               Republic. However, hybridization occurs very rarely among most of

               often grow in mixed populations, the ecological preferences of
               individual species are distinctly different in some cases.
               Anyway, flow cytometry is a very efficient method for taxonomic
               delimitation, determination and investigation of Callitriche
               species, and is even able to distinguish homoploid taxa and

              These rules are typically founded on research using well-known
              terrestrial taxa as models and it is thus uncertain whether
              aquatic macrophytes follow these macroecological rules. Our
              purpose is to draw together available information from broad-scale
              research on aquatic macrophytes growing in lakes, ponds, wetlands,
              rivers and streams. We summarize how different macroecological
              rules fit the patterns shown by freshwater plants at various
              spatial scales. Finally, we outline future actions which should be
              taken to advance macroecological research on freshwater plants.
              Our review suggested that some macroecological patterns are
              relatively well-evidenced for aquatic macrophytes, whereas little
              information exists for others. We found, for example, that the
              species richness-latitude relationship follows a unimodal pattern,
              and species turnover prevails over species nestedness, whereas
              higher nestedness-related richness differences are found in low
              beta diversity regions. Contrary to terrestrial plants, climate or
              history seem not to be dominant determinants explaining these
              broad-scale patterns; instead local explanatory variables (e.g.,
              water quality, such as alkalinity and nutrients, and
              hydromorphology) are often important for freshwater plants. We
              identified several knowledge gaps related, for example, to a
              smaller number of studies in lotic habitats, compared with lentic
              habitats, lack of spatially-adequate aquatic plant studies,
              deficiency of comprehensive species traits databases for aquatic
              macrophytes, and absence of a true phylogeny comprising most
              freshwater plant lineages. We hope this review will encourage the
              undertaking of additional macroecological investigations on
              freshwater plants across broad spatial and temporal scales.",

              distinguish between these hypotheses, I assembled a global dataset

              plasticity. These difficulties are even more pronounced in the
              case of interspecific hybridization. We investigate the aquatic
              plant genus Stuckenia for the first time on a worldwide scale.
              Expert species determination is aided by sequencing of nuclear
              ribosomal ITS and 5S-NTS regions and the plastid intergenic
              spacers rpl20-5'rps12 and trnT-trnL. Nuclear markers are used to
              infer hybridization, and the maternal origin of hybrids is
              addressed with plastid markers. Pure species are subjected to
              phylogenetic analyses. Two main Stuckenia lineages are found: one
              consists of S. amblyphylla, S. filiformis, S. pamirica, and S.
              vaginata, the other includes S. pectinata and S. striata. The
              widespread species S. pectinata, S. filiformis, and S. vaginata
              show intraspecific genetic variation, which is structured
              geographically. Many intraspecific hybrids, which are usually
              fertile, occur between those genotypes. Interspecific hybrids,
              which are consistently sterile, are detected among all widespread
              species; some are reported for the first time in several countries
              and regions. They originated multiple times from reciprocal
              crosses and reflect the geographical origins of parental
              genotypes. Intraspecific genetic variation can be higher than
              interspecific differences between closely related species.
              Comparison of phenotypic variation in the field and in cultivation
              with genotypic variation shows that numerous conspicuous forms
              have been overestimated taxonomically. These are resolved as
              phenotypes responding to unusual environments, have recurrently
              evolved adaptations, or represent extreme forms of continuous
              variation of the recognized species. However, some specific
              regional lineages, which have evolved from variable species, may
              be interpreted as early steps of the speciation process.
              Hybridization has been underestimated in some regions as a source
              of Stuckenia diversity, and the respective hybrid plants have been
              misidentified as intraspecific taxa or even as separate species.

              outbreeding or inbreeding depression. In selfing plants such as

              result of pairwise deleterious epistatic interactions between two
              alleles that can geographically co-occur. What remains elusive is
              how often alleles resulting in genetic incompatibilities co-occur
              in natural populations of outcrossing plant species. To address
              this question, we screened over two thousand five hundred wild
              Arabidopsis arenosa hybrid plants in search for potential genetic
              mismatches. We show that although abnormal deleterious phenotypes

              a repeated theme was increased homozygosity, indicating that

               records are noteworthy not only because they are the first in the
               British Pleistocene but also because of the geographical
               occurrences of these two species. Urtica kioviensis is absent
               from the British flora today and has a modern range in central
               and eastern Europe (only extending as far west as north-east
               Germany and Denmark), while the extinct Potamogeton sukaczevii
               has only been recovered from Late Pleistocene sediments in
               Belarus, Lithuania, Poland and western Russia. The presence of U.
               kioviensis along with other exotic species to the British Isles
               (e.g. Najas minor L. and Salvinia natans L., which today have
               central and southern ranges in Europe and in the case of S.
               natans occurs on other continents) may point to more continental
               conditions or warmer summer conditions during the second half of
               the Ipswichian Stage in southern Britain. No modern analogues
               occur in Britain for the assemblages recovered from Saham Toney.
               Evidence of colder winters or at least warmer summers at the time
               of deposition does not support the view that sea-level peaked in
               the Carpinus zone of the Eemian Stage (correlated with the
               Ipswichian Stage) associated with increased oceanicity. Southern
               Britain would have been under the influence of the Atlantic Ocean
               and a degree of oceanicity is supported by the presence of two
               thermophilous taxa, Hedera and Ilex, in the pollen spectra from
               Saham Toney. Alternative explanations for the presence of these
               exotic species are that they were tolerating mild winters and
               cooler summers at the time of deposition or exploiting suitable
               micro-environments. The distribution of P. sukaczevii is probably
               an artefact of the distribution of expertise in the
               identification of Potamogeton fossil endocarps rather than having
               any palaeogeographic or palaeoclimatic significance. It is an

              in Populus pseudo-simonii Kitag. The meiotic stage, duration of

              abnormalities, including failure of chromosome separation,
              chromosome stickiness, laggards and micronuclei. Spindle
              disorientations in the second meiotic division, such as parallel,

              were induced de novo by high temperature treatment. We found that

              repolymerise in some heat-treated cells after transferring them to

              unreduced 'big' (2n=4x) and 'jumbo' (4n=8x) pollen grains, which
              were clearly distinguished by size. Production of unreduced pollen
              was monitored in two tetraploid populations in 1997 and 1998. Mean
              population-level frequencies of unreduced pollen ranged from 0.030
              to 0.538\%, with as few as one-third and as many as one-half of

               causes of pollen allergy worldwide. Quantification of the roles
               of individual grass species in airborne pollen is an important
               task, because morphologically indistinguishable pollen grains of
               different species may differ in allergenicity. This requires
               knowledge of the pollen production of individual grass species;
               however, accumulated data are insufficient in this respect.
               Attempting to fill this gap, we studied pollen production per
               inflorescence in 29 grass species which are widespread in Middle
               Russia and India. Pollen production per inflorescence is
               determined by the number of grains per anther, the number of
               flowers in a spikelet and the number of spikelets per
               inflorescence, with the latter parameter being the most variable.
               We support the hypothesis that pollen production per
               inflorescence differs significantly between annual and perennial
               grasses. The greater pollen production of perennials can be
               interpreted as a tendency to guarantee cross-fertilization of
               species with self-incompatibility. The inferred pollen/ovule
               (P/O) ratios suggest the occurrence of facultative xenogamy in
               all annuals and obligate xenogamy in most perennials in the
               present dataset, though some self-incompatible annuals exist
               outside our sampling. Earlier data indicated that the P/O ratio
               of the annual cereal crop rye (Secale cereale) is higher than in
               any annual or perennial species sampled here. A ratio of pollen
               production to seed set (P/S ratio) is suggested to be another
               efficient parameter in reproductive biology of grasses. We
               highlight a need for detailed studies of reproductive biology in
               grasses that include both pollen and seed production. We found a
               correlation between pollen production per anther and anther
               length. A rough approximation of c. 1000 pollen grains per 1 mm
               of the length of an anther provides an instrument for estimates

               and flower position) were detected. In single donor pollinations,
               pollen size was negatively correlated with fertilization ability
               across donors, and positively correlated with postfertilization
               siring ability of donors. A second experiment used pairs of
               donors; within-plant differences in pollen size and flower
               position had effects similar to the single donor experiment on
               fertilization ability, but among-plant differences were not
               significant. The results corroborate earlier experiments that
               suggest that the growth of pollen tubes in the style is probably
               controlled by the recipient, since donor characters had minimal
               effects on pollen fertilization ability. Postfertilization siring
               ability was not affected by within-plant differences in mean
               grain size and production. For among-donor differences, the
               number of seeds set for each donor was positively correlated with
               the mean grain volume, and when a donor producing large pollen
               fertilized ovules in an ovary, there was increased seed abortion
               for seeds in the same ovary sired by a second donor. In addition,
               the total number of seeds produced by a fruit was decreased when
               both donors had large pollen, apparently due to increased
               postfertilization abortion. Postfertilization processes appear to
               be influenced by paternal differences that are expressed through
               competition among developing seeds for maternal resources.",

               Despite its worldwide economic importance and potential as a
               model for understanding diversification under domestication,
               insights into the number of domestication events and initial

               of clarity about the wild or feral status of conspecific noncrop
               relatives. To address this gap and reconstruct the domestication
               history of B. rapa, we analyzed 68,468
               genotyping-by-sequencing-derived single nucleotide polymorphisms

               One such example is the allopolyploid model species Arabidopsis
               suecica which originated c. 16 000 generations ago. We present
               here a comparison of meiosis and its outcomes in naturally
               evolved and first-generation 'synthetic' A. suecica using a

               re-sequencing of progeny revealed 20-fold higher levels of

               evolutionary innovations and adaptations, have been uncovered in
               many phylogenetic lineages. WGDs are frequently inferred from
               duplicate age distributions, where they manifest themselves as
               peaks against a small-scale duplication background. However, the
               interpretation of duplicate age distributions is complicated by
               the use of K(S), the number of synonymous substitutions per
               synonymous site, as a proxy for the age of paralogs. Two
               particular concerns are the stochastic nature of synonymous
               substitutions leading to increasing uncertainty in K(S) with
               increasing age since duplication and K(S) saturation caused by
               the inability of evolutionary models to fully correct for the
               occurrence of multiple substitutions at the same site. K(S)
               stochasticity is expected to erode the signal of older WGDs,
               whereas K(S) saturation may lead to artificial peaks in the
               distribution. Here, we investigate the consequences of these
               effects on K(S)-based age distributions and WGD inference by
               simulating the evolution of duplicated sequences according to
               predefined real age distributions and re-estimating the
               corresponding K(S) distributions. We show that, although K(S)
               estimates can be used for WGD inference far beyond the commonly
               accepted K(S) threshold of 1, K(S) saturation effects can cause
               artificial peaks at higher ages. Moreover, K(S) stochasticity and
               saturation may lead to confounded peaks encompassing multiple WGD
               events and/or saturation artifacts. We argue that K(S) effects
               need to be properly accounted for when inferring WGDs from age
               distributions and that the failure to do so could lead to false

               natural selection that forces populations to change and adapt, or

               biodiversity associated with climate change1 do not typically
               take into account how natural selection influences populations
               differently depending on their genetic makeup2. Here we make use
               of the extensive genome information that is available for
               Arabidopsis thaliana and measure how manipulation of the amount
               of rainfall affected the fitness of 517 natural Arabidopsis lines
               that were grown in Spain and Germany. This allowed us to directly
               infer selection along the genome3. Natural selection was
               particularly strong in the hot-dry location in Spain, where 63\%
               of lines were killed and where natural selection substantially
               changed the frequency of approximately 5\% of all genome-wide
               variants. A significant portion of this climate-driven natural
               selection of variants was predictable from signatures of local
               adaptation (R2 = 29-52\%), as genetic variants that were found in
               geographical areas with climates more similar to the experimental
               sites were positively selected. Field-validated predictions
               across the species range indicated that Mediterranean and western
               Siberian populations-at the edges of the environmental limits of
               this species-currently experience the strongest climate-driven
               selection. With more frequent droughts and rising temperatures in
               Europe4, we forecast an increase in directional natural selection
               moving northwards from the southern end of Europe, putting many
               native A. thaliana populations at evolutionary risk.",

              of adaptation from three independent freshwater lineages within
              the Alismatales. These three parallel lineages offer the unique
              opportunity to study convergent versus lineage-specific adaptation
              to a fully marine lifestyle. Here, we present chromosome-level
              genome assemblies from a representative species of each of the
              seagrass lineages - Posidonia oceanica (Posidoniaceae), Cymodocea
              nodosa (Cymodoceaceae), and Thalassia testudinum
              (Hydrocharitaceae) - along with an improved assembly for Zostera
              marina (Zosteraceae). We also include a draft genome of
              Potamogeton acutifolius , a representative of Potamogetonaceae,
              the freshwater sister lineage to the Zosteraceae. Genome analysis
              reveals that all seagrasses share an ancient whole genome
              triplication (WGT) event, dating to the early evolution of the
              Alismatales. An additional whole genome duplication (WGD) event
              was uncovered for C. nodosa and P. acutifolius . Dating of ancient
              WGDs and more recent bursts of transposable elements correlate
              well with major geological and recent climatic events, supporting
              their role as rapid generators of genetic variation. Comparative
              analysis of selected gene families suggests that the transition
              from the submerged-freshwater to submerged-marine environment did
              not require revolutionary changes. Major gene losses related to,
              e.g., stomata, volatiles, defense, and lignification, are likely a
              consequence of the submerged lifestyle rather than the cause (‘use
              it or lose it’). Likewise, genes, often retained from the WGD and
              WGT, were co-opted for functions requiring the alignment of many
              small adaptations (‘tweaking’), e.g., osmoregulation, salinity,
              light capture, carbon acquisition, and temperature. Our ability to
              manage and conserve seagrass ecosystems depends on our
              understanding of the fundamental processes underpinning their
              resilience. These new genomes will accelerate functional studies
              and are expected to contribute to transformative solutions — as
              continuing worldwide losses of the ‘savannas of the sea’ are of
              major concern in times of climate change and loss of biodiversity.

               compiled a checklist of 889 aquatic angiosperms in China,
               including 738 helophytes (emergent and marshy plants) and 151
               hydrophytes (submerged, free-floating, and floating-leaved
               plants). We explore the geographic patterns and environmental
               correlates of aquatic plant diversity based on six metrics
               including species richness (SR), weighted endemism (WE),
               phylogenetic diversity (PD), phylogenetic endemism (PE), the
               standardized effect size of phylogenetic diversity (PDses), and
               the standardized effect size of mean phylogenetic distance
               (MPDses). Our results show that the diversity of aquatic plants
               in China is extremely uneven, with high diversity in southeastern
               China and low diversity in northwestern China, and the geographic
               patterns of taxonomic and PD are generally consistent. The
               pattern of helophytes differs from that of hydrophytes. Notably,
               the wavy-shaped pattern of aquatic plant diversity (especially SR
               and PD for hydrophytes) across the latitude observed in this
               study is not consistent with those previously observed for
               aquatic plants in other continents. Climatic variables and water
               environmental variables are the main drivers of aquatic plant
               diversity in China; however, the effects of individual variables
               differ between helophytes and hydrophytes. Water environmental
               variables have a greater impact on PDses and MPDses of
               hydrophytes than those of helophytes. Overall, our work provides
               insight into understanding the large-scale patterns of aquatic

              orthologs as its close (and relatively unduplicated) relative
              Arabidopsis than had either of the other two subgenomes. One
              evolutionary scenario is that the two subgenomes with heavy gene
              losses (I and II) were in the same nucleus for a longer period of
              time than the third subgenome (III) with the fewest gene losses.
              This ``two-step'' hypothesis is essentially the same as that
              proposed previously for the eudicot paleohexaploidy; however, the
              more recent nature of the B. rapa paleohexaploidy makes this model
              more testable. We found that subgenome II suffered recent small
              deletions within exons more frequently than subgenome I, as would
              be expected if the genes in subgenome I had already been near

              that short--single or two-gene--deletions appear to dominate the

              patterns of the triplicated regions in the Brassica genome are
              best explained by a two-step fractionation model. The triplication

              we show that in addition to uneven ancient gene loss, the two

               in Arabis to the present, even though it is morphologically more
               similar to Arabidopsis, Braya, and Eutrema. Sequence data were
               obtained from representative taxa of Arabis, Arabidopsis, and
               related Boechera and Catolobus, Braya and Neotorularia, and
               Eutrema, Aphragmus, Lignariella, Neomartinella, Platycraspedum,
               Taphrospermum, and Thellungiella. The five Arabis arenicola
               accessions examined had ITS sequences that were identical to each
               other and to four Arabidopsis lyrata accessions. In both maximum
               parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses, Arabis arenicola fell
               within the Arabidopsis clade and was closely aligned with
               Arabidopsis lyrata. Two of six purportedly related genera were
               not closely related to Eutrema. Both analyses placed Lignariella
               within a separate well-supported clade with Aphragmus, while the
               other four genera, Neomartinella, Platycraspedum, Taphrospermum,
               and Thellungiella, fell within a well-supported clade with
               Eutrema. Morphology and molecular data strongly suggest
               transferring Arabis arenicola to Arabidopsis, expanding Aphragmus
               to include Lignariella, and expanding Eutrema to include
               Neomartinella, Platycraspedum, Taphrospermum, and Thellungiella.

              simple model describing transitions between odd and even base
              chromosome numbers. These new estimates indicate that ploidy
              changes may represent from 2 to 4\% of speciation events in
              flowering plants and 7\% in ferns. Speciation via polyploidy is
              likely to be one of the more predominant modes of sympatric
              speciation in plants, owing to its potentially broad-scale effects

              systems and phenotypes that have the potential to result in
              increased evolutionary diversification, yet conclusive evidence

               reconstruction from (nucleic acid) sequence data are notoriously
               plagued by two effects: homoplasies and alignment errors. Large
               evolutionary distances imply a large number of homoplastic sites.
               As most protein-coding genes show dramatic variations in
               substitution rates that are not uncorrelated across the sequence,
               this often leads to a patchwork pattern of (i) phylogenetically
               informative and (ii) effectively randomized regions. In highly
               variable regions, furthermore, alignment errors accumulate
               resulting in sometimes misleading signals in phylogenetic
               reconstruction. Results We present here a method that, based on
               assessing the distribution of character states along a cyclic
               ordering of the taxa, allows the identification of
               phylogenetically uninformative homoplastic sites in a multiple
               sequence alignment. Removal of these sites appears to improve the
               performance of phylogenetic reconstruction algorithms as measured
               by various indices of ``tree quality''. In particular, we obtain
               more stable trees due to the exclusion of phylogenetically
               incompatible sites that most likely represent strongly randomized
               characters. Software The computer program noisy implements this

               reconstruction capability with quite a considerable success rate

               the global method with local and homology-based methods, and
               evaluated them using measures specific for hierarchical problems.
               Genomes of animals and plants are crowded with Transposable
               Elements (TEs), which are DNA sequences capable to move within
               the genome of a cell. They can modify the functionality of host
               genes, which makes them extremely important for the genetic
               variability of species. Therefore, their correct classification
               is crucial to understand their role in evolution. In this paper,
               the classification of TEs is treated as a Hierarchical
               Classification problem making use of Evolutionary Computation.
               Thus, hierarchical datasets suitable to be used by ML methods are
               presented, along with a novel hierarchical global rule induction
               classification strategy using a Genetic Algorithm. To the best of
               our knowledge, this is the first attempt in the literature to
               apply a hierarchical global-based rule learner to induce a model
               which classifies TEs according to a hierarchical taxonomy. We
               compared our global method with local and homology-based methods,
               and evaluated them using measures specific for hierarchical
               problems. The experimental results showed that our proposal
               achieved better or competitive results if compared to
               state-of-the-art methods from the literature, having the
               advantage of presenting an interpretable set of classification
               rules.",

  abstract = "Selected Potamogeton taxa were studied to establish the levels of
              gene flow within species, and to test the identity of putative
              hybrids. 390 individuals from twelve British populations of the
              anemophilous aquatic Potamogeton coloratus were analysed using
              starch gel electrophoresis of isozymes. Low levels of variability
              were found, with evidence of considerable inbreeding and / or
              clonal spread. Only two of the populations sampled are
              polymorphic; both inhabit sites with a long post-glacial history
              as wetlands. Populations of recent origin, as well as some of
              older vintage, contain only a single multi-locus isozyme genotype.
              Evidence for a duplicated IDH locus is presented. A further 647
              individuals of Potamogeton coloratus from 60 ditches in the
              Gordano Valley, Somerset were analysed for variation at two
              polymorphic PGM loci. High levels of partitioning of genetic
              variation between ditches was observed with FST=0.575. A
              population of pondweeds from the River Stour in Dorset
              intermediate in morphology between Potamogeton natans L. and P.
              nodosus Poir. is shown by means of isozyme evidence to be the
              hybrid P. x schreberi G. Fisch. It is represented by a single
              multi-enzyme phenotype which, together with its sterility,
              suggests it reproduces vegetatively and may well constitute a
              single clone. It is genetically distinct from the morphologically
              similar hybrid between P. lucens L. and P. natans (P. x fluitans
              Roth). Genetic variation in Potamogeton pectinatus and P.
              filiformis was studied using isozymes. The overall levels of
              variability are similar to some other well-studied hydrophilous
              species, as well as to the average for terrestrial clonal species.
              Variation is shown to be distributed more between than within
              populations. Isozyme evidence supports the hypothesis that plants
              morphologically intermediate between Potamogeton pectinatus and P.
              filiformis are hybrids of these two species. Variation in enzyme
              banding patterns suggests that this hybrid has arisen on at least
              eleven occasions. In a review of molecular population genetic
              studies of aquatic plants, no significant difference was found
              between the levels of genetic diversity in aquatic plants compared
              to that found in clonal terrestrial plants. Many populations of
              aquatic plants do however show high levels of subdivision between
              populations.",

              hybrids composed of three different plant species is very rarely

              origin and a possible scenario for the rise of a sterile plant
              clone showing a combination of diagnostic morphological features
              of three separate, well-defined Potamogeton species. METHODS: The
              combination of sequences from maternally inherited cytoplasmic
              (rpl20-rps12) and biparentally inherited nuclear ribosomal DNA
              (ITS) was used to identify the exact identity of the putative
              triple hybrid. KEY RESULTS: Direct sequencing showed ITS variants
              of three parental taxa, P. gramineus, P. lucens and P.
              perfoliatus, whereas chloroplast DNA identified P. perfoliatus as
              the female parent. A scenario for the rise of the triple hybrid
              through a fertile binary hybrid P. gramineus x P. lucens crossed
              with P. perfoliatus is described. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the
              triple hybrid is sterile, it possesses an efficient strategy for
              its existence and became locally successful even in the parental
              environment, perhaps as a result of heterosis. The population
              investigated is the only one known of this hybrid, P. x
              torssanderi, worldwide. Isozyme analysis indicated the colony to
              be genetically uniform. The plants studied represented a single

              Due to the coexistence of closely related genomes, a successful
              allopolyploid must have the ability to invoke and maintain
              diploid-like behavior, both cytologically and genetically. Recent
              studies on natural and synthetic allopolyploids have raised many
              discrepancies. Most species have displayed non-Mendelian behavior
              in the allopolyploids, but others have not. Some species have
              demonstrated rapid genome changes following allopolyploid
              formation, while others have conserved progenitor genomes. Some
              have displayed directed, non-random genome changes, whereas others
              have shown random changes. Some of the genomic changes have
              appeared in the F1 hybrids, which have been attributed to the
              union of gametes from different progenitors, while other changes
              have occurred during or after genome doubling. Although these
              observations provide significant novel insights into the evolution
              of allopolyploids, the overall mechanisms of the event are still
              elusive. It appears that both genetic and epigenetic operations
              are involved in the diploidization process of allopolyploids.
              Overall, genetic and epigenetic variations are often associated
              with the activities of repetitive sequences and transposon
              elements. Specifically, genomic sequence elimination and
              chromosome rearrangement are probably the major forces guiding
              cytological diploidization. Gene non-functionalization,
              sub-functionalization, neo-functionalization, as well as other
              kinds of epigenetic modifications, are likely the leading factors
              promoting genetic diploidization.",

              from different subgenomes (homoeologous chromosomes) during
              meiosis is common. The initial stages of allopolyploid formation
              are characterized by a spectrum of saltational genomic and
              regulatory alterations that are responsible for evolutionary
              novelty. Here we highlight the possible effects and roles of
              recombination between homoeologous chromosomes during the early
              stages of allopolyploid stabilization. Homoeologous exchanges
              (HEs) have been reported in young allopolyploids from across the
              angiosperms. Although all lineages undergo karyotype change via
              chromosome rearrangements over time, the early generations after
              allopolyploid formation are predicted to show an accelerated rate
              of genomic change. HEs can also cause changes in allele dosage,
              genome-wide methylation patterns, and downstream phenotypes, and
              can hence be responsible for speciation and genome stabilization
              events. Additionally, we propose that fixation of duplication -
              deletion events resulting from HEs could lead to the production of
              genomes which appear to be a mix of autopolyploid and

               process under which deletions and rearrangements of various sizes
               scramble the genetic material, leading to a repacking of the
               genome and eventual return to diploidy. Here, we investigate the
               history of WGD in the columbine genus Aquilegia, a basal eudicot,
               and use it to illuminate the origins of the core eudicots.
               Within-genome synteny confirms that columbines are ancient
               tetraploids, and comparison with the grape genome reveals that
               this tetraploidy appears to be shared with the core eudicots.
               Thus, the ancient gamma hexaploidy found in all core eudicots
               must have involved a two-step process: first, tetraploidy in the
               ancestry of all eudicots, then hexaploidy in the ancestry of core
               eudicots. Furthermore, the precise pattern of synteny sharing

               threaten an organism's viability. Nevertheless, molecular
               innovation in telomere maintenance has occurred multiple times
               during eukaryote evolution, giving rise to species/taxa with
               unusual telomeric DNA sequences, telomerase components or
               telomerase‐independent telomere maintenance. The central
               component of telomere maintenance machinery is telomerase RNA
               (TR) as it templates telomere DNA synthesis, its mutation can
               change telomere DNA and disrupt its recognition by telomere
               proteins, thereby leading to collapse of their end‐protective and

               bioinformatic and experimental approaches, we examine a plausible
               scenario of evolutionary changes in TR underlying telomere
               transitions. We identified plants harbouring multiple TR paralogs
               whose template regions could support the synthesis of diverse
               telomeres. In our hypothesis, formation of unusual telomeres is
               associated with the occurrence of TR paralogs that can accumulate
               mutations, and through their functional redundancy, allow for the
               adaptive evolution of the other telomere components. Experimental
               analyses of telomeres in the examined plants demonstrate
               evolutionary telomere transitions corresponding to TR paralogs

              work has been done to model the genomic consequences and
              evolutionary significance of WGD. Since the machinations of
              diploidization are strongly influenced by the mode of speciation
              (whether a lineage was derived from ancient allo or
              autopolyploid), methods which can classify ancient whole genome
              duplication events as allo or auto are of great importance. Here
              we present a forward-time polyploid genome evolution simulator
              calledSpecKS. Using extensive simulations, we demonstrate that
              allo and autopolyploid-derived species exhibit differently shaped
              Ks histograms. We also demonstrate sensitivity of the Ks histogram
              to the effective population size (Ne) of the ancestral species.
              Our findings indicate that error in the common method of
              estimating WGD time from the Ks histogram peak scales with the
              degree of allopolyploidy, and we present an alternative, accurate
              estimation method that is independent of the degree of
              allopolyploidy. Lastly, we use SpecKS results to derive tests that
              reveal whether a genome is descended from allo or autopolyploidy,
              and whether the ancestral species had a high or low Ne. We apply
              this test to transcriptomic data for over 200 species across the

              their namesake to a fire-breathing monster from Greek mythology
              that has the head of a lion, the body of a goat, and the tail of a
              serpent. The first description of a non-fictional chimera dates
              back to the middle of the seventeenth century when the Florentine
              gardener Pietro Nati discovered an adventitious shoot growing from
              the graft junction between sour orange (Citrus aurantium) and
              citron (Citrus medica). This perplexing chimera that grows with
              sectors phenotypically resembling each of the citrus progenitors
              inspired discussion and wonder from the scientific community and
              was fittingly named the 'Bizzaria'. Initially, the 'Bizzaria' was
              believed to be an asexual hybrid that formed from a cellular
              fusion between the grafted parents; however, in-depth cellular
              analyses carried out centuries later demonstrated that the
              'Bizzaria', along with other chimeras, owe their unique sectored

              this pivotal discovery at the turn of the twentieth century,

              organismal, genetic, and genomic inner workings underlying the

              physiological tolerances are in conflict with ability to persist.
              Extreme examples of clonality over large spatial and temporal
              scales can occur where the life history of a species allows for
              it. We examine extreme clonality in an aquatic plant species at
              the edge if its range. Here we describe an ancient seagrass clone
              of unprecedented size inhabiting a 47 km stretch of a central
              Florida estuary, the Indian River Lagoon (IRL). Amongst the
              largest clones on earth detected, this Thalassia testudinum
              (turtlegrass) genet had ramets dispersed across 47 km of this
              water body. Indeed among 382 samples collections along the length
              of the IRL, 89\% were a single shared multilocus genotype.
              Furthermore, this clone was the only genet detected at 63\% of
              sample sites. The presence of such a large clone demonstrates they
              can form and persist over long periods. In addition, we must
              challenge the paradigm that fragmentation is not possible in this
              species. Reliance on clonality is an expected component of a
              classic 'bet-hedging' strategy enabling persistence on timescales
              typically not considered, including millennia. At locations near
              ocean inlets we did find a few other individuals of T. testudinum
              supporting the concept that recruitment is dispersal limited.
              These additional clones indicate there is the potential, albeit
              limited, for seeds based recruitment to occur when environmental
              conditions are favorable during a ``window of opportunity.''
              Extreme clonality represents a potential strategy for survival
              such that in the extreme, clonal populations of a species would be
              the first to decline or disappear if conditions extend beyond the
              adaptability of the local genotype. This disappearance possibility

               visualization that can provide more insight into the structure
               and function of these complex networks. Results To address this
               need, we have developed a software tool named BioFabric, which
               uses a novel network visualization technique that depicts nodes
               as one-dimensional horizontal lines arranged in unique rows. This
               is in distinct contrast to the traditional approach that
               represents nodes as discrete symbols that behave essentially as
               zero-dimensional points. BioFabric then depicts each edge in the
               network using a vertical line assigned to its own unique column,
               which spans between the source and target rows, i.e. nodes. This
               method of displaying the network allows a full-scale view to be
               organized in a rational fashion; interesting network structures,
               such as sets of nodes with similar connectivity, can be quickly
               scanned and visually identified in the full network view, even in

               hybridisation fuelled by developments in genomics has led to an
               improved understanding of the genetic factors that promote or
               prevent species cross-mating. Despite this body of work
               overturning many widely held assumptions about the genetic
               barriers to hybridisation, it is still widely thought that ploidy
               differences between species will be an absolute barrier to
               hybridisation and introgression. Here, we revisit this
               assumption, reviewing findings from surveys of polyploidy and
               hybridisation in the wild. In a case study in the British flora,
               203 hybrids representing 35\% of hybrids with suitable data have
               formed via cross-ploidy matings, while a wider literature search
               revealed 59 studies (56 in plants and 3 in animals) in which
               cross-ploidy hybridisation has been confirmed with genetic data.
               These results show cross-ploidy hybridisation is readily
               overlooked, and potentially common in some groups. General
               findings from these studies include strong directionality of
               hybridisation, with introgression usually towards the higher
               ploidy parent, and cross-ploidy hybridisation being more likely
               to involve allopolyploids than autopolyploids. Evidence for
               adaptive introgression across a ploidy barrier and cases of

               genome duplication (WGD) is a dramatic mutation with long-lasting
               effects, yet it occurs repeatedly in all eukaryotic kingdoms.
               Plants are particularly rich in documented WGDs, with recent and
               ancient polyploidization events in all major extant lineages.
               However, challenges immediately following WGD, such as the
               maintenance of stable chromosome segregation or detrimental
               ecological interactions with diploid progenitors, commonly do not
               permit establishment of nascent polyploids. Despite these
               immediate issues some lineages nevertheless persist and thrive.
               In fact, ecological modelling supports patterns of adaptive niche
               differentiation in polyploids, with young polyploids often
               invading new niches and leaving their diploid progenitors behind.
               In line with these observations of polyploid evolutionary
               success, recent work documents instant physiological consequences
               of WGD associated with increased dehydration stress tolerance in
               first-generation autotetraploids. Furthermore, population genetic
               theory predicts both short- and long-term benefits of polyploidy
               and new empirical data suggests that established polyploids may
               act as ‘sponges’ accumulating adaptive allelic diversity. In
               addition to their increased genetic variability, introgression
               with other tetraploid lineages, diploid progenitors, or even
               other species, further increases the available pool of genetic
               variants to polyploids. Despite this, the evolutionary advantages
               of polyploidy are still questioned, and the debate over the idea
               of polyploidy as an evolutionary dead-end carries on. Here we
               broadly synthesise the newest empirical data moving this debate
               forward. Altogether, evidence suggests that if early barriers are
               overcome, WGD can offer instantaneous fitness advantages opening
               the way to a transformed fitness landscape by sampling a higher
               diversity of alleles, including some already preadapted to their
               local environment. This occurs in the context of intragenomic,
               population genomic, and physiological modifications that can, on
               occasion, offer an evolutionary edge. Yet in the long run, early
               advantages can turn into long-term hindrances, and without
               ecological drivers such as novel ecological niche availability or
               agricultural propagation, a restabilization of the genome via
               diploidization will begin the cycle anew.",

               facilitating adaptive allele discovery. In some cases, high
               levels of introgression elicit the replacement of large numbers
               of alleles inherited from the polyploid's ancestral species,

               were the progenitor species and which taxa provided additional
               introgressive blocks through subsequent hybridization. Here, we
               use population-level genomic data to reconstruct the phylogenetic
               history of Betula pubescens (downy birch), a tetraploid species
               often assumed to be of allopolyploid origin and which is known to
               hybridize with at least four other birch species. This was
               achieved by modeling of polyploidization and introgression events

               Bayesian computation (ABC) rejection algorithm to evaluate and
               compare competing polyploidization models. We provide evidence
               that B. pubescens is the outcome of an autoploid genome doubling
               event in the common ancestor of B. pendula and its extant sister
               species, B. platyphylla, that took place approximately
               178,000-188,000 generations ago. Extensive hybridization with B.
               pendula, B. nana, and B. humilis followed in the aftermath of
               autopolyploidization, with the relative contribution of each of
               these species to the B. pubescens genome varying markedly across
               the species' range. Functional analysis of B. pubescens loci
               containing alleles introgressed from B. nana identified multiple
               genes involved in climate adaptation, while loci containing
               alleles derived from B. humilis revealed several genes involved
               in the regulation of meiotic stability and pollen viability in

              while Syzygium shares an ancient genome doubling event with other
              Myrtales, little evidence exists for recent polyploidy events.
              Phylogenomics confirms that Syzygium originated in Australia-New

              berchtoldii displayed low levels of variation within populations
              associated with high levels of interpopulation differentiation.
              This pattern of partitioning of genetic variation within and
              between populations is attributed to the founder effect, frequent
              vegetative propagation by turions, dominant self-fertilization and
              limited seedling recruitment. The mechanism of pollen transfer was
              investigated in cultivation. Effective pollination takes place in
              air above the water surface (autogamy, geitonogamy, anemogamy), on
              the water surface (epihydrogamy) or below water surface
              (hydroautogamy). The species are self-compatible. The low level of
              infra-population variation together with rare occurrence of

              pollination, although the protogynous flowers may occasionally

              By using different experimental approaches including fluorescence

              is incorporated into an analysis of variance format, derived from
              a matrix of squared-distances among all pairs of haplotypes. This
              analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) produces estimates of
              variance components and F-statistic analogs, designated here as
              phi-statistics, reflecting the correlation of haplotypic diversity
              at different levels of hierarchical subdivision. The method is
              flexible enough to accommodate several alternative input matrices,
              corresponding to different types of molecular data, as well as
              different types of evolutionary assumptions, without modifying the
              basic structure of the analysis. The significance of the variance
              components and phi-statistics is tested using a permutational
              approach, eliminating the normality assumption that is
              conventional for analysis of variance but inappropriate for
              molecular data. Application of AMOVA to human mitochondrial DNA
              haplotype data shows that population subdivisions are better
              resolved when some measure of molecular differences among
              haplotypes is introduced into the analysis. At the intraspecific
              level, however, the additional information provided by knowing the
              exact phylogenetic relations among haplotypes or by a nonlinear
              translation of restriction-site change into nucleotide diversity
              does not significantly modify the inferred population genetic
              structure. Monte Carlo studies show that site sampling does not
              fundamentally affect the significance of the molecular variance
              components. The AMOVA treatment is easily extended in several
              different directions and it constitutes a coherent and flexible

              is the effective population size and mu is the mutation rate per
              generation per nucleotide site. Under the assumption that
              mutations are selectively neutral and a population size is

               self-compatibility alleviates this problem, it has long been
               hypothesized that there should be an association between
               polyploidy and self-compatibility (SC), but empirical support for
               this prediction is mixed. Here, we investigate whether the

               system, and specifically dominance relationships among
               S-haplotypes mediated by small RNAs, could facilitate loss of SI
               in allopolyploid crucifers. We focus on the allotetraploid
               species Capsella bursa-pastoris, which formed ~300 kya by
               hybridization and whole-genome duplication involving progenitors

               and analyze eight full-length S-locus haplotypes, representing
               both homeologous subgenomes of C. bursa-pastoris. We further
               analyze small RNA (sRNA) sequencing data from flower buds to

               orientalis-derived S-haplotypes of C. bursa-pastoris harbor
               truncated versions of the male SI specificity gene SCR and
               express a conserved sRNA-based candidate dominance modifier with

               somatic tetraploidization after a wide cross between C.
               orientalis and C. grandiflora can result in production of

              However, combining diploid and polyploid data can theoretically
              lead to biased inference with (artefactual) clustering by ploidy.
              We used simulated mixed-ploidy (diploid-autotetraploid) data to
              systematically compare the performance of k-means clustering and
              the model-based clustering methods implemented in STRUCTURE,
              ADMIXTURE, FASTSTRUCTURE and INSTRUCT under different scenarios of
              differentiation and with different marker types. Under scenarios
              of strong population differentiation, the tested applications

              inference with markers with limited genotypic information
              (co-dominant markers with unknown dosage or dominant markers).
              Still, since STRUCTURE was comparatively slow, the much faster but

              was superior to FASTSTRUCTURE in terms of power and speed. We

               found that, for both species richness and species composition,

              allotetraploid with two subgenomes A, and B, presenting asymmetric

              seem to share an older WGD that is shared by most other monocots.

              RESULTS: Here, we generate three near-complete genome assemblies,
              a tetraploid Brachypodium hybridum and its two diploid ancestors,
              Brachypodium distachyon and Brachypodium stacei. We detect high
              degrees of sequence, structural, and epigenetic variations of
              centromeres at base-pair resolution between closely related
              Brachypodium genomes, indicating the appearance and accumulation
              of species-specific centromere repeats from a common origin during

              accompanied by local satellite repeats bursting and
              retrotransposon purging, and the frequency of retrotransposon
              invasions drives the degree of interspecies centromere
              diversification. We further investigate the dynamics of

              dramatic genetics and epigenetics architecture variations are
              associated with the turnover of centromeres between homologous

               approaches that emphasize the role of floral design and display
               in pollen dispersal and fitness gain through male function. Wide
               variation in outcrossing rate characterizes animal–pollinated
               plants. In species with large floral displays, part of the
               selfing component of mixed mating can arise from geitonogamy and
               be maladaptive because of strong inbreeding depression and pollen
               discounting. Floral strategies that separate the benefits of
               floral display from the mating costs associated with geitonogamy
               can resolve these conflicts by reducing lost mating opportunities

               Elucidating the evolutionary processes promoting genome
               stabilization and fertility is thus essential to comprehend
               allopolyploid success. Using the Brassica model, we mimicked the
               speciation process of a nascent allopolyploid species by
               resynthesizing allotetraploid Brassica napus and systematically
               selecting for euploid individuals over eight generations in four
               independent allopolyploidization events with contrasted genetic
               backgrounds, cytoplasmic donors, and polyploid formation type. We
               evaluated the evolution of meiotic behavior and fertility and
               identified rearrangements in S1 to S9 lineages to explore the
               positive consequences of euploid selection on B. napus genome

               generations drastically reduced the percentage of aneuploid
               progenies as early as the fourth generation, concomitantly with a
               decrease in number of newly fixed homoeologous rearrangements.
               The consequences of homoeologous rearrangements on meiotic
               behavior and seed number depended strongly on the genetic
               background and cytoplasm donor. The combined use of both

               identification of genomic regions associated with fertility and
               meiotic behavior, providing complementary evidence to explain B.

               types of polyploidy have played during evolution has been
               difficult. Unbalanced and balanced gene removal was previously
               related to allopolyploidies and autopolyploidies, respectively.
               Here, to infer the types of polyploidies and evaluate their
               evolutionary effects, we devised a statistic, the
               Polyploidy-index or P-index, to characterize the degree of
               divergence between subgenomes of a polyploidy, to find whether
               there has been a balanced or unbalanced gene removal from the

               responsible for establishment of major tribes such as Poaceae and

              of divergence between the genes that are brought together in the
              new polyploid lineage. Because allopolyploids are formed via
              hybridization, the homoeologous copies of genes within them are at
              least as divergent as orthologs in the parental species that came
              together to form them. This means that common methods for
              estimating the parental lineages of allopolyploidy events are not
              accurate, and can lead to incorrect inferences about the number of
              gene duplications and losses. Here, we have adapted an algorithm
              for topology-based gene-tree reconciliation to work with
              multi-labeled trees (MUL-trees). By definition, MUL-trees have
              some tips with identical labels, which makes them a natural
              representation of the genomes of polyploids. Using this new

              hybridized to form allopolyploids, distinguish between allo-,

              number of duplications and losses in a set of gene trees. We
              validate our method using gene trees simulated with and without
              polyploidy, and revisit the history of polyploidy in data from the

               These can cause gene disruption and large-scale genomic
               alterations, including inversions, deletions, and duplications.
               Host organisms have evolved a set of mechanisms to suppress TE
               activity and counter the threat that they pose to genome
               integrity. These includes the epigenetic silencing of TEs
               mediated by a process of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). In
               most cases, the silencing machinery is very efficient for the
               vast majority of TEs. However, there are specific circumstances
               in which TEs can evade such silencing mechanisms, for example, a
               variety of biotic and abiotic stresses or in vitro culture.

               Finally, we ran forward genetic simulations with varying

               These simulations showed that population history has a greater

  abstract  = "DNA diversity varies across the genome of many species. Variation
               in diversity across a genome might arise from regional variation
               in the mutation rate, variation in the intensity and mode of
               natural selection, and regional variation in the recombination
               rate. We show that both noncoding and nonsynonymous diversity are
               positively correlated to a measure of the mutation rate and the
               recombination rate and negatively correlated to the density of
               conserved sequences in 50 kb windows across the genomes of humans
               and nonhuman homininae. Interestingly, we find that although
               noncoding diversity is equally affected by these three genomic
               variables, nonsynonymous diversity is mostly dominated by the
               density of conserved sequences. The positive correlation between
               diversity and our measure of the mutation rate seems to be
               largely a direct consequence of regions with higher mutation
               rates having more diversity. However, the positive correlation
               with recombination rate and the negative correlation with the
               density of conserved sequences suggest that selection at linked
               sites also affect levels of diversity. This is supported by the
               observation that the ratio of the number of nonsynonymous to
               noncoding polymorphisms is negatively correlated to a measure of
               the effective population size across the genome. We show these
               patterns persist even when we restrict our analysis to
               GC-conservative mutations, demonstrating that the patterns are
               not driven by GC biased gene conversion. In conclusion, our
               comparative analyses describe how recombination rate, gene
               density, and mutation rate interact to produce the patterns of
               DNA diversity that we observe along the hominine genomes.",

               understanding human evolution. Various studies have found
               evidence for a founder event (bottleneck) in East Asian and
               European populations, associated with the human dispersal
               out-of-Africa event around 60 thousand years (kyr) ago. However,
               these studies have had to assume simplified demographic models
               with few parameters, and they do not provide a precise date for
               the start and stop times of the bottleneck. Here, with fewer
               assumptions on population size changes, we present a more
               detailed history of human population sizes between approximately
               ten thousand and a million years ago, using the pairwise
               sequentially Markovian coalescent model applied to the complete
               diploid genome sequences of a Chinese male (YH), a Korean male
               (SJK), three European individuals (J. C. Venter, NA12891 and

               NA19239). We infer that European and Chinese populations had very
               similar population-size histories before 10-20 kyr ago. Both
               populations experienced a severe bottleneck 10-60 kyr ago,

               which they recovered earlier. All three populations have an
               elevated effective population size between 60 and 250 kyr ago,
               possibly due to population substructure. We also infer that the
               differentiation of genetically modern humans may have started as
               early as 100-120 kyr ago, but considerable genetic exchanges may
               still have occurred until 20-40 kyr ago.",

               distributions are actively studied in terrestrial and marine
               ecosystems, but much less is known on the geographical patterns
               of ecoregions founded on freshwater taxa. Here, we studied, for
               the first time, how well existing freshwater ecoregions describe
               the geographical distribution of inland water
               plants.LocationGreenland, continental Canada and
               USA.TaxonFreshwater vascular plants of all taxa and multiple
               functional groups (i.e. growth forms).MethodsUsing newly
               available fine‐grained data on freshwater plant distributions, we
               studied how ecoregions founded on fish are suitable for
               freshwater plant regionalization across North America.
               Specifically, we calculated internal homogeneity and distinctness
               among neighbouring ecoregions in relation to species replacements
               and richness differences. We also explored how a complex suite of
               ecogeographical characteristics affect ecoregion delineation of
               freshwater plants using spatially explicit regression
               routines.ResultsWe found a clear geographical patterning of
               ecoregion robustness for North American freshwater plants, with
               communities being more internally homogeneous and more similar to
               one another in Polar and Subtropical inland waters. The degree of
               internal homogeneity and ecoregion distinctness were almost
               equally driven by species replacements and richness differences.
               Considering different life‐forms, ecoregion delineation performed
               best for emergent and floating‐leaved plants. Finally,
               within‐ecoregion homogeneity and distinctness were best explained
               by annual mean temperature and terrain ruggedness, respectively,
               with mean water alkalinity, ecoregion area and late Quaternary
               glacial legacies having supplementary effects.Main conclusionsOur
               findings suggest that selection through climate filtering (e.g.
               mean annual temperature) is likely the main mechanistic driver of
               freshwater plant ecoregions. Geographical regionalizations
               founded on a particular organismal group may not be directly
               applicable for all taxa but can be a good basis for further
               adjustments. Our study is a promising starting point for further
               investigations of geographical delineations for freshwater taxa

               variables influencing it remain largely unexplored north of the
               Arctic Circle, including possible effects of past colonisation
               routes. Our understanding of species diversity north of the
               Arctic Circle has also been hampered by a lack of control in
               sampling effort. Here we use a newly assembled set of lake
               surveys from Norway to test: (1) whether regional richness (γ
               diversity) as well as turnover, net gain and loss (β diversity)
               of species differ between bioclimatic zones, latitudinal bands,
               and geographical regions; (2) how the environment and the spatial
               structure (e.g. dispersal constraints) may predict lake species
               richness (α diversity); and (3) how the changes in species β
               diversity between lakes are related to these environmental and
               spatial gradients. We expected high species turnover with
               longitude, net species loss with latitude and higher species
               richness in north‐east compared to mid Norway due to geographical
               dispersal barriers and past recolonisation routes. However, the
               regional species richness was similar across all geographical
               regions after correcting for sampling effort and spatial extent,
               with slightly lower richness in north Norway (−4\%) and
               north‐east Norway (−11\%) than expected by the species area
               relationship. Species β diversity (both turnover and loss) was
               also surprisingly low between most areas. Species richness per
               lake increased with lake area and temperature, showed a
               preferential peak at 10 μg/L total phosphorus, was sensitive to
               spatial structure, and largely indifferent to calcium (or
               alkalinity). In contrast, β diversity (mostly turnover) increased
               with differences in calcium, total phosphorus, and latitude,
               while not responding much to temperature and lake area. Species
               loss and gain between lakes were hardly related to any of the
               selected variables. Overall, species richness (α, γ) was higher
               than expected north of the Arctic Circle mostly due to species
               turnover with little net loss. These patterns suggested good
               dispersal abilities by aquatic plants, after controlling for
               sampling efforts and spatial extent. Conservation of aquatic
               plants should not be driven by the delineation of terrestrial
               vegetation zones, but through an understanding of the variables
               affecting aquatic plant diversity. Finally, northern lakes may be
               increasingly important as reservoirs of macrophyte diversity
               under global warming.",

               theoretical discussions have included a very narrow range of the
               variation in forms of clonal reproduction and have tended to
               exclude many of the more common forms amongst aquatic

               significance of cloning in plants have focused on the dichotomy
               of compact versus diffusely spreading types and are still too
               narrow to provide a broad understanding. In this paper the case
               for the existence of six major categories of selective forces

               species richness decreased with increasing concentrations of
               these two variables. Maximum temperature of the warmest month and
               mean annual temperature most affected plant community
               composition, whereas species richness had a negative relationship
               with minimum temperature of the coldest month. Most significant
               explanatory variables (e.g. alkalinity, total phosphorus and
               temperature) were geographically structured, showing a
               latitudinal change. Conclusions Community composition and species
               richness of macrophytes were congruently influenced by regional
               (climate) and local patterns (water quality) at regional scale.
               Community composition and species richness of helophytes and
               submerged macrophytes were equally explained by environmental
               gradients. The latitudinal change in these most significant
               environmental variables was related to calcareous soils and
               intensive agriculture, which were situated in the southern part
               of the state. Macrophyte species richness showed a reverse
               latitudinal gradient, which was likely due to high nutrient
               concentrations in southern latitude lakes. Water quality
               primarily filters species from the regional species pool,
               allowing only species tolerating high nutrient concentrations,

               and geomorphology) of emergent aquatic macrophyte distributions,
               which were derived from the national subclass of CORINE
               land-cover classification. The accuracy of the distribution
               models (GAMs) was cross-validated, using percentage of explained
               deviance and the area under the curve derived from the
               receiver-operating characteristic plots. Results Our results
               indicated that emergent aquatic macrophytes will expand their
               distributions northwards from the current catchments and
               percentage cover will increase in all of the catchments in all
               climate scenarios. Growing degree-days was the primary
               determinant affecting distributions of emergent aquatic
               macrophytes. Inclusion of geomorphological variables clearly
               improved model performance in both model exercises compared with
               pure climate variables. Main conclusions Emergent aquatic
               macrophyte distributions will expand due to climate change. Many
               emergent aquatic plant species have already expanded their
               distributions during the past decades, and this process will
               continue in the years 2051–80. Emergent aquatic macrophytes pose
               an increasing overgrowth risk for sensitive macrophyte species in
               boreal freshwater ecosystems, which should be acknowledged in
               management and conservation actions. We conclude that predictions
               based on GIS data can provide useful ‘first-filter’ estimates of
               changes in aquatic–terrestrial ecotones.",

               (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation,
               vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target
               temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60
               000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated
               using thin‐plate splines with covariates including elevation,
               distance to the coast and three satellite‐derived covariates:
               maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud
               cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation
               was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station
               density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for
               temperature variables 5–15\% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for
               areas with a low station density, although prediction error
               remained high in such regions for all climate variables.
               Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for
               the other variables, although their importance varied by region.
               In contrast to the common approach to use a single model
               formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final
               product by selecting the best performing model for each region

               vectors, migratory movement data have never been integrated in
               estimates of propagule dispersal distances and LDD probability.
               Here we integrated migratory movement data of two waterbird
               species (mallard and teal) over two continents (Europe and North
               America) and gut retention time of different propagules to build
               a simple mechanistic model of passive dispersal of aquatic plants
               and zooplankton. Distance and frequency of migratory movements
               differed both between waterbird species and continents, which in
               turn resulted in changes in the shapes of propagule dispersal
               curves. Dispersal distances and the frequency of LDD events
               (generated by migratory movements) were mainly determined by the
               disperser species and, to a lesser extent, by the continent. The
               gut retention time of propagules also exerted a significant
               effect, which was mediated by the propagule characteristics (e.g.
               seeds were dispersed farther than Artemia cysts). All estimated
               dispersal curves were skewed towards local‐scale dispersal and,
               although dispersal distances were lower than previous estimates
               based only on the vector flight speed, had fat tails produced by
               LDD events that ranged from 230 to 1209 km. Our results suggest
               that propagule dispersal curves are determined by the migratory
               strategy of the disperser species, the region (or flyway) through
               which the disperser population moves, and the propagule
               characteristics. Waterbirds in particular may frequently link
               wetlands separated by hundreds of kilometres, contributing to the
               maintenance of biodiversity and, given the large geographic scale
               of the dispersal events, to the readjustment of species

               in determining patterns of biodiversity may vary across spatial
               scales. In inland aquatic communities, macrophytes and
               zooplankton have the potential to disperse over large spatial
               scales (hundreds of kilometres), but the role of environmental
               and regional processes in determining species richness (SR) at
               different spatial scales is poorly understood. To assess the
               relative importance of environmental and regional processes
               acting on both regional (within‐region) and continental
               (among‐region) scales, we surveyed 139 waterbodies in five
               geographic regions (Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Scotland and
               Norway) and in each region measured environmental variables,
               descriptors of connectivity and SR of two aquatic taxa, namely
               aquatic plants and cladocerans. Analyses using boosted regression
               trees and generalised linear models, integrated with multiple
               imputation of missing data, indicated that both environmental and
               regional processes were related to local SR. Total phosphorus was
               the main environmental correlate of SR, showing a unimodal
               relationship with both taxonomic groups. Conductivity and lake
               depth were also related to cladoceran SR, and Secchi depth was
               related to aquatic plant richness. The SR of aquatic plants and
               cladocerans were significantly correlated, but this relationship
               was mainly indirect (i.e. determined by the effect of common
               environmental variables). The limited role of connectivity and
               space (lack of spatial autocorrelation in model residuals)
               relative to environment suggests that dispersal limitation is not
               as important as the environment in explaining richness patterns
               for both groups within regions. However, region identity strongly
               influenced SR, which suggests an important effect of
               biogeographic factors (e.g. the level of endemicity; the number
               of unique species in each region) and/or dispersal limitation at
               the continental scale. We conclude that environmental factors and
               biogeographic processes largely determine the patterns of local
               and regional SR in aquatic plants and zooplankton.",

               within each metacommunity (i.e., across-region approach). In the

               importance of local variables, climate variables, and spatial
               location on lake macrophytes among the study regions. In the
               across-region approach, we used adjusted R2 values of the
               variation partitioning to model the community-environment
               relationships across multiple metacommunities using linear

               filtering related to local lake-level environmental conditions

               to dispersal limitation) was important for macrophytes based on
               the findings of the across-metacommunities analysis. These
               findings suggest that different determinants influence macrophyte
               metacommunities within different regions, thus showing context
               dependency. Moreover, our study emphasized that the use of a
               single metacommunity scale gives incomplete information on the

               was calculated with the Sorensen dissimilarity index (and further
               partitioned into turnover and nestedness components). We assessed
               the individual correspondence of macrophyte beta diversity with
               local (water quality and habitat structure; after pre‐selection
               procedures on each explanatory matrix) and climatic environmental
               drivers, as well as with the geographical distances, through

               important for hydrophytes than helophytes). The distinct

               (ii) field hydrological and geochemical observations carried out
               within the delta since 2002. Periods with differing relative
               discharge and intensity of fluvial processes were identified from
               the long-term record of water and sediment discharge. Ice events
               during spring melt (high water) reconfigured branch channels and
               probably influenced sediment transport within the delta. Based on

               sediment fluxes along main delta channels, both are increased

               a great extent connected with an additional influx of water from

               the main sedimentary units of the three major geomorphic
               terraces, which form the delta. The development of the terraces
               is controlled by complex interactions among the following four
               factors: (1) Channel migration. According to the distribution of
               14C and IR-OSL age determinations of Lena mouth sediments, the
               major river runoff direction shifted from the west during marine
               isotope stages 5–3 (third terrace deposits) towards the northwest
               during marine isotope stage 2 and transition to stage 1 (second
               terrace), to the northeast and east during the Holocene (first
               terrace deposits). (2) Eustasy. Sea level rise from Last Glacial
               lowstand to the modern sea level position, reached at 6–5 ka BP,
               resulted in back-filling and flooding of the palaeovalleys. (3)
               Neotectonics. The extension of the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge into
               the Laptev Sea shelf acted as a halfgraben, showing dilatation
               movements with different subsidence rates. From the continent
               side, differential neotectonics with uplift and transpression in
               the Siberian coast ridges are active. Both likely have influenced
               river behavior by providing sites for preservation, with uplift,
               in particular, allowing accumulation of deposits in the second
               terrace in the western sector. The actual delta setting comprises
               only the eastern sector of the Lena Delta. (4) Peat formation.
               Polygenetic formation of ice-rich peaty sand (“Ice Complex”) was
               most extensive (7–11 m in thickness) in the southern part of the
               delta area between 43 and 14 ka BP (third terrace deposits). In
               recent times, alluvial peat (5–6 m in thickness) is accumulated
               on top of the deltaic sequences in the eastern sector (first

               predictions relating to abiotic factors and plant communities.
               The way key abiotic factors in aquatic habitats affect (1) plant
               life (recruitment, growth, and reproduction) and dispersal, and
               (2) the dynamics of plant communities is discussed. Many factors
               related to plant nutrition are rather similar in both aquatic and
               terrestrial habitats (e.g. light, temperature, substrate nutrient
               content, CO2 availability) or differ markedly in intensity (e.g.
               light), variations (e.g. temperature) or in their effective
               importance for plant growth (e.g. nutrient content in substrate
               and water). Water movements (water-table fluctuations or flow
               velocity) have particularly drastic consequences on plants
               because of the density of water leading to strong mechanical
               strains on plant tissues, and because dewatering leads to
               catastrophic habitat modifications for aquatic plants devoid of
               cuticle and support tissues. Several abiotic factors that affect
               aquatic plants, such as substrate anoxia, inorganic carbon
               availability or temperature, may be modified by global change.
               This in turn may amplify competitive processes, and lead
               ultimately to the dominance of phytoplankton and floating
               species. Conserving the diversity of aquatic plants will rely on

               independently inferred gene trees to obtain a species tree, are
               sensitive to hard-to-avoid errors introduced in the gene tree
               estimation step. This dilemma has created much debate on the
               merits of concatenation versus summary methods and practical
               obstacles to using summary methods more widely and to the
               exclusion of concatenation. The most successful attempt at making
               summary methods resilient to noisy gene trees has been
               contracting low support branches from the gene trees.
               Unfortunately, this approach requires arbitrary thresholds and
               poses new challenges. Here, we introduce threshold-free weighting
               schemes for the quartet-based species tree inference, the metric

               weighting provides stronger theoretical guarantees and better

              studies of Utricularia mainly from West and Central Europe with
              our data from East Europe and North Asia. We combined molecular
              barcoding (nuclear ITS and plastid rps16 regions) and
              fingerprinting (ISSR) techniques (74 collection localities) with
              morphological analysis of herbarium collections (more than 1800

              morphological variation of U. macrorhiza in comparison with U.
              vulgaris supported the treatment of the former as a separate
              species. We have revealed U. tenuicaulis previously treated as

              macrorhiza (U. × japonica) in the Russian Far East and the latter
              additionally in southwestern East Siberia, outside their known

              between U. tenuicaulis and U. vulgaris. The sterile hybrid (U. ×

              Utricularia ochroleuca and U. stygia represent a complex of
              sterile forms with continuous morphological variation (U. ×
              ochroleuca) originated from hybridization between U. intermedia

              this poorly known taxon. For a single triploid sample, our results
              suggested an autopolyploid origin from C. stagnalis. Four

              effects on their distributions, besides the determination of major
              disjunctions (tropical–temperate–subarctic). Dispersal should have
              been frequent enough to assure the quick colonisation of extensive
              areas following glacial retreat, but dispersal limitation is still
              apparent in areas separated by geographic barriers. Aquatic
              vascular plants also show limited taxonomic differentiation and
              low within-species genetic variation. Variation within populations
              is particularly low, but variation among populations seems to be
              relatively high, mainly due to the persistence of long-lived
              clones. Ecotypic differentiation is often related to factors that
              constrain clonal reproduction (salinity and ephemeral inundation).
              Inland aquatic habitats are heterogeneous environments, but this
              heterogeneity largely occurs at relatively small scales (within
              waterbodies and among neighbouring ones). They also represent a
              stressful environment for plants, characterised by low carbon
              availability, shaded conditions, sediment anoxia, mechanical
              damage by currents and waves, significant restrictions to sexual
              reproduction, and sometimes also osmotic stress and limited
              nutrient supply. I propose that the generality of broad
              distributions and low differentiation among the inland aquatic
              flora is best explained by a combination of: (1) selection for
              stress-tolerant taxa with broad tolerance ranges. (2) The
              selective advantages provided by clonal growth and multiplication,
              which increases plant tolerance to stress, genet survivorship and
              population viability. (3) Long-distance dispersal of sexual
              propagules and high local dispersal of asexual clones. (4) The
              generality of broad plastic responses, promoted by the combination
              of clonal growth, high local dispersal, small-scale spatial
              heterogeneity and temporal variability.",

                  flowering plants have long stimulated phytogeographical
                  discussion. Although aquatic plants occur rarely among the
                  angiosperms, they represent a disproportionately large number
                  of taxa with broad distributions including various
                  intercontinental disjunctions that are manifest even at the
                  species level. Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth
                  centuries, long‐range dispersal by waterfowl was the
                  prevailing explanation for widespread aquatic plant
                  distributions. This explanation gradually fell into disfavor
                  as biologists raised doubts as to the ability of waterfowl to
                  transport propagules across the extensive transoceanic
                  distances between the continents on which an assortment of
                  aquatic taxa now reside. During the twentieth century, the
                  development of biogeographical displacement theory, i.e.,
                  “continental drift,” steadily began to supplant dispersal as
                  the preferred explanation for discontinuous angiosperm
                  distributions. Our study assesses the dispersal/displacement
                  hypotheses from a temporal standpoint using molecular
                  estimates of divergence time for a diverse sample of
                  phylogenetically related aquatic taxa that exhibit
                  discontinuous intercontinental distributions. With few
                  exceptions, we found divergence times that are far too recent
                  to implicate continental drift as a major determinant of
                  discontinuous distributions in aquatic plants. We suggest that
                  long‐distance dispersal by birds should continue to be
                  regarded as a viable explanation for widely disjunct aquatic
                  plant distributions, although such dispersal is likely to have
                  involved a combination of overland as well as transoceanic

              propagules that differ in size, resource status, and genetic
              identity. Accordingly, the balance between sexual and clonal
              reproduction has important ecological and evolutionary
              consequences for dispersal, recruitment, and spatial patterns of
              genetic diversity within and among populations. Here, we review
              the diversity of aquatic plant life histories and reproductive
              modes and consider: (1) their effects on patterns of dispersal
              across spatial scales ranging from the local population to
              inter-continental transport; (2) how clonality affects sexual
              fitness via trade-offs and mating patterns; (3) the roles of
              sexual versus clonal reproduction in population establishment and
              in the subsequent spread of invasive aquatic plants; (4) how the
              contrasting properties of sexually- versus clonally-derived
              propagules in terms of dispersal and competition potentially
              influence patterns of selection on reproductive mode; (5) the
              roles of phenotypic plasticity, somatic mutations and epigenetic
              inheritance in promoting invasion success in widespread clonal
              aquatic species. We conclude our review by identifying profitable
              areas for future enquiry in an effort to provide a robust agenda
              for future research on the ecology and evolution of aquatic
              plants.",

              extensive habitats for alpine plants in the world. Climatic
              oscillations during the Quaternary ice age had a dramatic effect
              on species ranges on the QTP and the adjacent areas. However, how
              the distribution ranges of aquatic plant species shifted on the
              QTP in response to Quaternary climatic changes remains almost
              unknown. Methodology and Principal Findings We studied the
              phylogeography and demographic history of the widespread aquatic
              herb Hippuris vulgaris from the QTP and adjacent areas. Our
              sampling included 385 individuals from 47 natural populations of
              H. vulgaris. Using sequences from four chloroplast DNA (cpDNA)
              non-coding regions, we distinguished eight different cpDNA
              haplotypes. From the cpDNA variation in H. vulgaris, we found a
              very high level of population differentiation (GST = 0.819) but
              the phylogeographical structure remained obscure (NST = 0.853>GST
              = 0.819, P>0.05). Phylogenetic analyses revealed two main cpDNA
              haplotype lineages. The split between these two haplotype groups
              can be dated back to the mid-to-late Pleistocene (ca. 0.480 Myr).
              Mismatch distribution analyses showed that each of these had
              experienced a recent range expansion. These two expansions (ca.
              0.12 and 0.17 Myr) might have begun from the different refugees
              before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Conclusions/Significance
              This study initiates a research on the phylogeography of aquatic
              herbs in the QTP and for the first time sheds light on the
              response of an alpine aquatic seed plant species in the QTP to

              Three genera include hermaphroditic species, 8 have monoecious
              species, and 13 have dioecious species. The prevalence of dicliny
              in hydrophiles has led to assumptions of outcrossing and high
              levels of genetic variability in these plants. Many
              water-pollinated species, however, may often fail to meet all
              conditions necessary for outcrossing. In hydrophiles, decreased

              asexual reproduction and clonal growth in many hydrophile

              invasions in North America, yet the geographic origin of the
              invasion remains unknown. The objectives of our study included
              determining the geographic origin of Eurasian watermilfoil in
              North America as well as the maternal lineage of the hybrids.
              METHODS: DNA sequence data from a cpDNA intron and the nrDNA ITS
              region were compiled for accessions from 110 populations of
              Eurasian watermilfoil and hybrids from North America and the
              native range (including Europe, Asia, and Africa). Datasets were
              analyzed using statistical parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetics to
              assess the geographic origin of the invasion. KEY RESULTS: The two
              Eurasian watermilfoil cpDNA haplotypes in North America are also
              found from China and Korea, but not elsewhere in the native range.
              These haplotypes did not overlap and were limited in native
              geographic range. The ovule parent for hybrids can come from
              either parental lineage, and multiple haplotypes from both
              parental species were found. CONCLUSIONS: The geographic origin of
              this prolific aquatic plant invasion of North America is in Asia.
              This provides critical information to better understand the
              invasion pathway and inform management into the future.",

              Here, we studied the historical range shifts of the aquatic herb

              differentiation (GST = 0.914; NST = 0.954). But the high
              population differentiation was not coupled with a distinct

              flow levels. The response of species when extending northwards
              since the Last Glacial Maximum can be opposed to the structuring
              of their populations that survived glaciation cycles in southern
              regions. The peri-Mediterranean is a complex series of sea basins,
              coastlines, islands and river deltas with a unique history since
              the Messinian Crisis that potentially influenced allopatric
              processes of aquatic life. We tested whether vast ranges across
              Europe and the peri-Mediterranean of a global seagrass group
              (Ruppia species complexes) can be explained by either overall high
              levels of gene flow or vicariance through linking population
              genetics, phylogeography and shallow phylogenetics. A multigene
              approach identified haplogroup lineages of two species complexes,

              allopatric origin was left at basin level, including basal African
              lineages. Thus both vicariance in the South and high levels of

              phylogenies from which disjunction patterns, ancestral areas and
              directions of movement could be inferred. We considered 66 plant
              clades with species variously endemic today to eastern Asia (EA),
              Europe (including southwestern Asia), eastern North America (ENA),
              and/or western North America (WNA). Within these clades we focused
              on 100 disjunctions among these major areas, for 33 of which
              absolute divergence times have also been inferred. Our analyses
              uphold the view that disjunctions between EA and ENA are
              exceptionally common in plants, apparently more so than in
              animals. Compared with animals, we find few disjunctions between
              EA and WNA, consistent with increased extinction in WNA or failure
              of some groups to colonize that region. Taken at face value, our
              data also support the view that many temperate forest plant groups
              originated and diversified within EA, followed by movement out of
              Asia at different times, but mostly during the last 30 Myr. This
              favours Beringia over a North Atlantic land bridge as the primary
              path between the Old World and the New World. Additional studies
              are needed, especially to evaluate the impacts of differential
              extinction on these patterns, to more confidently establish
              divergence times, and to assess the statistical significance of
              these findings. Fortunately, many more plant groups show relevant
              disjunction patterns and could soon be added to such analyses.",

              phylogroups, as well as relatively high nucleotide diversity
              estimates within phylogroups, indicate that the distinct
              phylogeographical structure was initiated by historical events
              that predated the latest glaciation. European root voles are
              divided into a Northern and a Central mtDNA phylogroup. The mtDNA
              data in concert with fossil records imply that root voles remained
              north of the classical refugial areas in southern Europe during
              the last glacial period. The currently fragmented populations in

              initiated to facilitate biodiversity studies, identify juveniles,
              associate sexes, and enhance forensic analyses. The cytochrome c
              oxidase 1 sequence, which has been found to be widely applicable
              in animal barcoding, is not appropriate for most species of plants
              because of a much slower rate of cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene

              the nuclear internal transcribed spacer region and the plastid

              applying barcoding to flowering plants. The internal transcribed

              and plant species have been conducted for several areas, most
              notably for Europe and the Pacific Northwest of North America.
              Until recently, phylogeographical studies in unglaciated eastern
              North America have been largely limited to animals. As more
              studies emerge for diverse lineages (including plants), it seems
              timely to assess the phylogeography across this region: (i)
              comparing and contrasting the patterns seen in plants and animals;
              (ii) assessing the extent of pseudocongruence; and (iii)
              discussing the potential applications of regional phylogeography
              to issues in ecology, such as response to climatic change.
              Unglaciated eastern North America is a large, geologically and
              topographically complex area with the species examined having
              diverse distributions. Nonetheless, some recurrent patterns
              emerge: (i) maritime — Atlantic vs. Gulf Coast; (ii) Apalachicola
              River discontinuity; (iii) Tombigbee River discontinuity; (iv) the
              Appalachian Mountain discontinuity; (v) the Mississippi River
              discontinuity; and (vi) the Apalachicola River and Mississippi
              River discontinuities. Although initially documented in animals,
              most of these patterns are also apparent in plants, providing
              support for phylogeographical generalizations. These patterns may
              generally be attributable to isolation and differentiation during
              Pleistocene glaciation, but in some cases may be older (Pliocene).
              Molecular studies sometimes agree with longstanding hypotheses of
              glacial refugia, but also suggest additional possible refugia,
              such as the southern Appalachian Mountains and areas close to the
              Laurentide Ice Sheet. Many species exhibit distinct patterns that
              reflect the unique, rather than the shared, aspects of species’
              phylogeographical histories. Furthermore, similar modern
              phylogeographical patterns can result from different underlying
              causal factors operating at different times (i.e.
              pseudocongruence). One underemphasized component of
              pseudocongruence may result from the efforts of researchers to
              categorize patterns visually — similar patterns may, in fact, not
              fully coincide, and inferring agreement may obscure the actual
              patterns and lead to erroneous conclusions. Our modelling analyses
              indicate no clear spatial patterning and support the hypothesis
              that phylogeographical structure in diverse temperate taxa is
              complex and was not shaped by just a few barriers.",

              Cladocera) species complex, which is common in various aquatic
              habitats. We found populations of this species complex in 30 of
              154 waterbodies across China. Analysis of DNA sequences from a
              portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene
              placed these populations in three lineages, one of them not
              previously recognized. There was a clear geographical separation
              of C. sphaericus lineages: lineage A2-1 was the only lineage
              detected on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, whereas lineages A3-1 and
              A3-2 were present elsewhere in China. Several lineages (and even
              individual haplotypes) were widespread in Eurasia, suggesting an
              ability to disperse over long distances. Phylogenies based on
              nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer fragments (both
              ITS-1 and ITS-2) recognized two distinct C. sphaericus clades in
              China. Interestingly, one specimen possessing mtDNA of lineage
              A3-2 was found unexpectedly to have an ITS-1 allele normally
              associated with mitochondrial lineage A2-1, and ITS-2 alleles
              consistent with this. This discordance between mtDNA and nuclear
              phylogenies is indicative of interspecific hybridization and gene
              introgression between different members of the species complex.
              This study contributes to an understanding of the genetic
              diversity of the C. sphaericus species complex in a Eurasian
              context.",

              this issue, we collected 11 phylogeographic studies of plants by
              Chinese laboratories. We further synthesized the main findings and
              patterns emerging from these and previous phylogeographic studies
              in China and asked where phylogeographic research should be
              directed in the coming years. Numerous examples have shown that
              phylogeographic patterns in China did not show an expected
              expansion–contraction pattern at large scale, mirroring the
              geological records showing that no unified ice sheet had developed
              in China during the Quaternary Period. Instead, regional
              expansions and intraspecific divergences are very common in most
              studied species during the Quaternary oscillations. Different
              intraspecific lineages or alleles (haplotypes) were detected in
              multiple localized refugia, from where regional or local
              expansions are likely to have started. Hybridizations and
              introgressions are frequent between intraspecific lineages or

              spatial–temporal dimensions and underlying speciation mechanisms

              that connects the genus phylogeny (macroevolution) and speciation
              and adaptation (microevolution). Therefore, we advocate that: (i)
              phylogeographic studies of plants in China should be directed to
              the closely related species or a monophyletic group (for example,
              a genus or a section) in the coming years; and (ii) population
              genetic data based on direct sequencing multiple loci, especially
              those from nuclear genome and statistical tests should be widely
              adopted and enforced. The recovered intraspecific divergences and
              phylogeographic patterns of multiple-species may allow us to
              better understand the high plant diversity in China and set up

              sequences are the staple data source of low-level phylogeographic

              previous papers (tortoise and hare II and III) that sought to
              identify the most consistently variable regions of NC-cpDNA. We
              used an exhaustive literature review and newly available whole
              plastome data to assess applicability of previous conclusions at
              low taxonomic levels. • Methods: We aligned complete plastomes of
              25 species pairs from across angiosperms, comparing the number of
              genetic differences found in 107 NC-cpDNA regions and matK. We
              surveyed Web of Science for the plant phylogeographic literature
              between 2007 and 2013 to assess how NC-cpDNA has been used at the
              intraspecific level. • Key results: Several regions are
              consistently the most variable across angiosperm lineages:
              ndhF-rpl32, rpl32-trnL(UAG), ndhC-trnV(UAC), 5′rps16-trnQ(UUG),
              psbE-petL, trnT(GGU)-psbD, petA-psbJ, and rpl16 intron. However,
              there is no universally best region. The average number of regions
              applied to low-level studies is ∼2.5, which may be too little to

              lower and lower taxonomic levels. Our findings corroborate earlier
              works, suggesting that there are regions that are most likely to
              be the most variable. However, while NC-cpDNA sequences are
              commonly used in plant phylogeographic studies, few of the most
              variable regions are applied in that context. Furthermore, it

              origin and early diversiﬁcation of monocots. Despite their
              importance, phylogenetic ambiguity regarding the root of the

              perfoliatus (Potamogetonaceae), Sagittaria lichuanensis
              (Alismataceae), and Toﬁeldia thibetica (Toﬁeldiaceae). Each family
              possesses the typical quadripartite structure, with plastid genome
              sizes of 156,226, 179,007, and 155,512 bp, respectively. Among
              them, the plastid genome of S. lichuanensis is the largest in
              monocots and the second largest in angiosperms. Like other
              sequenced Alismatales plastid genomes, all three families
              generally encode the same 113 genes with similar structure and
              arrangement. However, we detected 2.4 and 6 kb inversions in the
              plastid genomes of Sagittaria and Potamogeton, respectively.
              Further, we assembled a 79 plastid proteincoding gene sequence
              data matrix of 22 taxa that included the three newly generated
              plastid genomes plus 19 previously reported ones, which together

              More importantly, Toﬁeldiaceae was resolved as the most basal

              be easily obtained (e.g. multi-sample low-coverage sequencing or

              development of new methods for analyzing sequence data with

              based on sequencing data without explicit genotyping or

              algorithm that only uses pairwise genetic distances, avoiding the
              computational burden of phylogenetic reconstruction. Importantly,
              ASAP proposes species partitions ranked by a new scoring system
              that uses no biological prior insight of intraspecific diversity.
              ASAP is a stand-alone program that can be used either through a
              graphical web-interface or that can be downloaded and compiled for
              local usage. We have assessed its power along with three others
              programs (ABGD, PTP and GMYC) on 10 real COI barcode data sets
              representing various degrees of challenge (from small and easy
              cases to large and complicated data sets). We also used
              Monte-Carlo simulations of a multispecies coalescent framework to
              assess the strengths and weaknesses of ASAP and the other
              programs. Through these analyses, we demonstrate that ASAP has the
              potential to become a major tool for taxonomists as it proposes
              rapidly in a full graphical exploratory interface relevant species
              hypothesis as a first step of the integrative taxonomy process.",

              greatly facilitated the discussion and testing of hypotheses.
              However, it is well known that more complex evolutionary scenarios
              are poorly described by such models. Even when evolution proceeds
              in a tree-like manner, analysis of the data may not be best served
              by forcing the data onto a tree or assuming a tree-like model.
              Rather, visualization and exploration of the data to discover and
              evaluate its properties can be an essential ﬁrst step. Recognition
              of these issues has led to the development of a number of
              different types of phylogenetic networks (see Fig. 1). In this
              article we ﬁrst discuss the terminology used to describe and
              distinguish between the different types of phylogenetic networks
              and methods that are currently in use. There are a number of
              different types of phylogenetic networks, and this can be a source
              of confusion. We then provide a detailed introduction to split
              networks, how they are deﬁned, and how they can be interpreted. We
              discuss the use of split networks in strategies for dealing with
              systematic error, especially as a preliminary step to tree-based
              analysis and show examples of a number of different types of
              networks. We outline the beginnings of a statistical framework for
              phylogenetic inference using split network methods. Split networks
              have been widely used as a tool for visualization but have been
              neglected as a tool for statistical inference. Their success as a
              tool for visualizing incompatible and ambiguous phylogenetic
              signals suggests that if they are properly used, they can become
              an invaluable statistical inference tool for phylogenetics. Here
              we describe a method for constructing approximate conﬁdence
              intervals (CIs) for trees using networks and a simple test to
              determine whether an incompatible signal in a network is
              statistically signiﬁcant. There is considerable scope for
              improvement of both methods.",

              providing tools for performing this step, adequate detail is still
              missing. Here, we present the kuenm R package, a new set of tools
              for performing detailed development of ecological niche models
              using the platform Maxent in a reproducible way. Results This
              package takes advantage of the versatility of R and Maxent to
              enable detailed model calibration and selection, final model
              creation and evaluation, and extrapolation risk analysis. Best
              parameters for modeling are selected considering (1) statistical
              significance, (2) predictive power, and (3) model complexity. For
              final models, we enable multiple parameter sets and model
              transfers, making processing simpler. Users can also evaluate
              extrapolation risk in model transfers via mobility-oriented parity

              processes of model calibration, facilitating creation of final

              effects of factors affecting the predictions from species
              distribution models (SDMs). They demonstrate their approach by
              generating presence–absence data sets for different simulated
              species and analysing them using four modelling methods: three
              presence–absence methods and Maxent, which is a
              presence-background modelling tool. One of their results is
              striking: that their use of Maxent performs well in estimating
              occupancy probabilities and even outperforms the other methods on
              small sample sizes. This result is of concern to us, because it
              suggests that Maxent directly offers a useful alternative for
              modelling presence–absence data, which may prompt widespread
              adoption of this use of Maxent. In this paper, we explore why this
              would be a mistake. We draw on the theory underlying how the
              Maxent model operates and on simulations to discover: (i) why
              Maxent appears to fare as well as it does in their evaluation and
              (ii) why the best-suited presence–absence method for data analysis
              (the generating model; a GLM) does not perform as well as we would
              expect. We demonstrate that (i) the good performance observed for
              Maxent is largely a coincidence; the simulated species match well
              the arbitrary default parameter that Maxent applies to map its
              relative output into a 0–1 scale, but errors are much larger for
              other species we simulate; (ii) the performance of the GLM is
              poorer than expected because Thibaud et al. do not use model
              selection and fit a model that is too complex for the amount of
              data available. Maxent is a presence-background method and only
              provides estimates of relative suitability regardless of how the
              background sample is specified. When presence–absence data are
              available, one can transform Maxent's relative estimates into
              estimates of occupancy probability, and we provide methods to do
              so. However, this requires the user to post-process Maxent's
              output. Proper PA methods such as GLMs can perform well under
              small sample sizes, provided care is taken during modelling to
              avoid overfitting. We demonstrate an effective method using
              regularisation with the R package glmnet.",

              distance matrix and, using an agglomerative process, constructs a
              fully resolved (bifurcating) phylogenetic tree. Dozens of
              simulation studies and thousands of phylogenetic analyses have
              demonstrated that NJ is both fast and quite accurate. This success
              has in turn inspired many variations on the theme, including BioNJ
              and UNJ (Gascuel 1997a, 1997b), Weighbor-Joining (Bruno, Socci,
              and Halpern 2000), and NJML (Ota and Li 2000). In this article we
              describe a new variant of NJ, one which constructs phylogenetic
              networks instead of phylogenetic trees. Phylogenetic networks
              generalize phylogenetic trees because they permit the
              representation of conﬂicting signal or alternative phylogenetic
              histories (Fitch 1997). The use of networks, rather than simple
              branching trees, is clearly necessary when the underlying
              evolutionary history is not treelike. Recombination,
              hybridization, gene conversion, and gene transfer all lead to
              histories that are not adequately modelled by a single tree. Even
              when the underlying history is treelike, parallel evolution, model
              heterogeneity, and sampling error may make it difﬁcult to
              determine a unique tree. In these cases networks can provide a
              valuable tool for representing ambiguity or for visualizing a
              space of feasible trees. There are a number of phylogenetic
              network methods already in use—Posada and Crandall (2001) provide
              a comprehensive review. The methods divide roughly into two
              classes. The ﬁrst class includes methods that construct networks
              directly from character data, typically under a parsimony
              framework. The nodes in the network represent taxa (for example,
              different haplotypes), hypothetical ancestral taxa, or
              intermediary nodes. The bestknown network methods in this class
              are statistical parsimony (Templeton, Crandall, and Sing 1992),
              median networks (Bandelt et al. 1995), the variants of median
              networks (Bandelt, Forster, and Ro¨hl 1999; Huber et al.",

              genes. De novo assemblies were generated using multiple
              assemblers, and BLAST searches were performed for CYC1, CYC2, and
              CYC3 genes. Results: Overall Trinity, SOAPdenovo-Trans, and
              SOAPdenovo implementing lower k-mer values uncovered the most
              data, although no assembler consistently outperformed the others.
              Using SOAPdenovo-Trans across all 24 data sets, we recovered four
              CYC-like gene groups (CYC1, CYC2, CYC3A, and CYC3B) from a
              majority of the species. Alignments of the fragments included the
              entire coding sequence as well as upstream and downstream regions.

              source of low-copy nuclear gene sequence data that may be used for
              multiple downstream applications.",

              However, efficient methods to obtain high-quality chloroplast DNA
              (cpDNA) are currently not available, impeding powerful sequencing
              and further functional genomics research. To investigate effects

              sucrose density gradient centrifugation, high-salt buffer, and

              hundreds of nuclear loci for phylogeny reconstruction. Much of the
              cost of developing targeted sequencing approaches is associated
              with the generation of preliminary data needed for the
              identification of orthologous loci for probe design. In plants,
              identifying orthologous loci has proven difficult due to a large
              number of whole-genome duplication events, especially in the
              angiosperms (flowering plants). We used multiple sequence
              alignments from over 600 angiosperms for 353 putatively
              single-copy protein-coding genes identified by the One Thousand
              Plant Transcriptomes Initiative to design a set of targeted
              sequencing probes for phylogenetic studies of any angiosperm
              group. To maximize the phylogenetic potential of the probes, while
              minimizing the cost of production, we introduce a k-medoids
              clustering approach to identify the minimum number of sequences
              necessary to represent each coding sequence in the final probe
              set. Using this method, 5–15 representative sequences were
              selected per orthologous locus, representing the sequence
              diversity of angiosperms more efficiently than if probes were
              designed using available sequenced genomes alone. To test our
              approximately 80,000 probes, we hybridized libraries from 42
              species spanning all higher-order groups of angiosperms, with a
              focus on taxa not present in the sequence alignments used to
              design the probes. Out of a possible 353 coding sequences, we
              recovered an average of 283 per species and at least 100 in all
              species. Differences among taxa in sequence recovery could not be
              explained by relatedness to the representative taxa selected for
              probe design, suggesting that there is no phylogenetic bias in the
              probe set. Our probe set, which targeted 260 kbp of coding
              sequence, achieved a median recovery of 137 kbp per taxon in
              coding regions, a maximum recovery of 250 kbp, and an additional
              median of 212 kbp per taxon in flanking non-coding regions across
              all species. These results suggest that the Angiosperms353 probe
              set described here is effective for any group of flowering plants
              and would be useful for phylogenetic studies from the species
              level to higher-order groups, including the entire angiosperm

              species in the same habitat. Additionally, comparisons of the
              effect of habitat types and species are largely missing.
              Methodology and Principal Findings We estimated the importance of
              the habitat type and species for population dynamics of plants.
              Specifically, we compared the dynamics of two closely related
              species, the allotetraploid species Anthericum liliago and the
              diploid species Anthericum ramosum, occurring in the same habitat
              type. We also compared the dynamics of A. ramosum in two
              contrasting habitats. We examined three populations per species
              and habitat type. The results showed that single life history
              traits as well as the mean population dynamics of A. liliago and
              A. ramosum from the same habitat type were more similar than the
              population dynamics of A. ramosum from the two contrasting
              habitats. Conclusions Our findings suggest that when transferring
              knowledge regarding population dynamics between populations, we
              need to take habitat conditions into account, as these conditions
              appear to be more important than the species involved (ploidy
              level). However, the two species differ significantly in their
              overall population growth rates, indicating that the ploidy level
              has an effect on species performance. In contrast to what has been
              suggested by previous studies, we observed a higher population
              growth rate in the diploid species. This is in agreement with the
              wider range of habitats occupied by the diploid species.",

              environmental preferences of Potamogetonaceae species in Turkey.
              We aimed to understand the relationship between distribution of
              species and hydrochemistry using canonical correspondence
              analysis. Distribution and abundance patterns of species along an
              altitudinal gradient were also investigated. We collected 14
              Potamogetonaceae species from 96 wetlands throughout Turkey and
              measured 10 water chemistry parameters. The most important
              environmental variables were electrical conductivity (EC), water
              temperature (Tw), dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH. These variables
              explained 5.9\% of the total variance. Potamogeton coloratus had
              the lowest Tw and pH and the highest EC optima. Potamogeton
              gramineus preferred high Tw and pH and the lowest EC. Stuckenia
              amblyphylla had high DO and low Tw and EC preferences. Potamogeton
              natans sampled from highlands had the lowest DO optima. Stuckenia
              pectinata had the highest tolerance for EC and, along with P.
              crispus, the highest Tw tolerance. Remaining species are
              widespread with broad altitudinal distributions and average values
              of environmental parameters. The most vulnerable species are P.
              coloratus, S. amblyphylla and P. gramineus as they have special
              habitat preferences and narrow tolerances.",

                 evolutionary event generating many new genes and which may play
                 a role in survival through mass extinctions. Paddlefish and
                 sturgeon are sister lineages that both show genomic evidence
                 for ancient WGD. Until now this has been interpreted as two
                 independent WGD events due to a preponderance of duplicate
                 genes with independent histories. Here we show that although
                 there is indeed a plurality of apparently ‘independent’ gene
                 duplications, these derive from a shared genome duplication
                 event occurring close to the Permian-Triassic mass extinction
                 period, followed by a prolonged process of reversion to stable
                 diploid inheritance (rediploidisation). We show that the
                 sharing of this WGD is masked by the fact that paddlefish and
                 sturgeon lineage divergence occurred before rediploidisation
                 had proceeded even half-way. Thus, for most genes the
                 resolution to diploidy was lineage-specific. Because genes are
                 only truly duplicated once diploid inheritance is established,
                 the paddlefish and sturgeon genomes are a mosaic of shared and
                 non-shared gene duplications resulting from a shared genome
                 duplication event. This is the first time that lineage-specific
                 resolution of genes from a common WGD event has been shown to
                 affect such a large proportion of the genome.",

              systematic practice infers species trees from collections of
              sequences under assumptions of the multispecies coalescent (MSC),
              that is, that there is free recombination between the sequences
              and no (or very low) recombination within them. These coalescent
              genes (c-genes) are thus defined in an historical rather than
              molecular sense and can in theory be as large as an entire genome
              or as small as a single nucleotide. A debate about how to define
              c-genes centers on the contention that nuclear gene sequences used
              in many coalescent analyses undergo too much recombination, such
              that their introns comprise multiple c-genes, violating a key
              assumption of the MSC. Recently a similar argument has been made
              for the genes of plastid (e.g., chloroplast) and mitochondrial
              genomes, which for the last 30 or more years have been considered
              to represent a single c-gene for the purposes of phylogeny
              reconstruction because they are nonrecombining in an historical
              sense. Consequently, it has been suggested that these genomes
              should be analyzed using coalescent methods that treat their
              genes—over 70 protein-coding genes in the case of most plastid
              genomes (plastomes)—as independent estimates of species phylogeny,
              in contrast to the usual practice of concatenation, which is
              appropriate for generating gene trees. However, although
              recombination certainly occurs in the plastome, as has been
              recognized since the 1970’s, it is unlikely to be phylogenetically
              relevant. This is because such historically effective
              recombination can only occur when plastomes with incongruent
              histories are brought together in the same plastid. However,
              plastids sort rapidly into different cell lineages and rarely
              fuse. Thus, because of plastid biology, the plastome is a more
              canonical c-gene than is the average multi-intron mammalian
              nuclear gene. The plastome should thus continue to be treated as a
              single estimate of the underlying species phylogeny, as should the
              mitochondrial genome. The implications of this long-held insight
              of molecular systematics for studies in the phylogenomic era are
              explored. [c-gene; coalescent gene; concatalescence; organelle

              exposed in the homozygous backgrounds of selfers should be under
              strong purifying selection. Here, we examine estimates of the

              approach to detect the joint influence of mating system and the
              dominance of deleterious mutations on selection efficacy. We
              investigated predictions from our simulations in the annual plant

              implications of differences among species or groups of
              functionally similar species, but the ecological importance of
              variation within species has received less attention. There is
              rapidly growing evidence that genetic and phenotypic variation
              within species can have important effects on community and
              ecosystem processes. In some cases, variation within a single
              keystone species may have effects as large as those from the
              incidence of that keystone species. The general importance of
              variation within species, compared to variation among species, is
              not yet clear. Here we conduct a meta-analysis to ask: how
              important is variation within species relative to variation among
              species for community and ecosystem function? Our meta-analysis
              takes advantage of two complementary methods by which ecologists
              have quantified the importance of species and genotype: removal
              and replacement studies, and biodiversity studies. From the
              removal and replacement studies, we quantified a species effect
              and an intraspecific effect, and then calculated the log ratio of
              those two effects as a measure of the relative strength of the two
              forms of diversity. From the biodiversity studies we calculated
              the CV for ANPP and arthropod responses among monocultures (of
              species or genotype), and the effect size of increasing diversity
              from the monoculture to the full polyculture for ANPP and
              arthropod responses. Results/Conclusions We found evidence for
              very strong intraspecific effects across all of the removal and
              replacement studies. For animal studies, the log ratio of
              intraspecific to species effect size was not significantly
              different than zero, indicating that intraspecific effects were of
              similar magnitude to species effects. For plant studies, the log
              ratio of intraspecific to species effects was significantly
              greater than zero, indicating that intraspecific effects were much
              stronger than species effects. For diversity studies, we found no
              significant difference in the CV among monocultures of genotypes
              or species for ANPP and arthropod community structure, indicating
              that there was a similar amount of phenotypic variation among and
              within species. In contrast, increasing species richness had much
              greater effects on ANPP and arthropod community structure than
              increasing genetic richness, indicating that increasing genetic
              diversity has much less effect on communities and ecosystems than
              increasing species diversity. Overall, we found that effects of
              variation within species can be as large or larger than species
              effect. Our results suggest variation within species should
              receive greater attention among in community and ecosystem

              to characterize the aerial-flowered taxa. The supposition that
              hyphydrophily characterizes submerged-flowered taxa derives from
              observations of underwater seed production. Hyphydrophily is often
              associated with larger pollen and, like anemophily, generally
              implies xenogamy and stochastic pollen delivery-features
              predicting high pollen/ovule (P/O) ratios. Relative to this, we
              present data from limited breeding studies and extensive analyses
              of pollen size and P/O ratios of North American species. The
              species tested were partly autogamous. Aerial-flowered species
              bear larger pollen and show significantly higher P/O ratios than

              alternative to hyphydrophily for the submerged-flowered species of
              Potamogeton. Hydroautogamy is proposed to define a special class
              of autogamy; e.g., in Potamogeton, wherein self pollination is
              effected by pollen moving from anthers to stigmas over the surface
              of air bubbles. Autogamy is posited as a more likely first
              hypothesis in studies of breeding systems of submerged-flowering
              angiosperms with bisexual flowers. We also suggest that in
              Potamogeton P/O ratios reflect both breeding and pollination
              systems. A model is presented that shows how higher P/O ratios,
              than the breeding system of a taxon would imply, could be
              generated by the added effect of the pollination system.",

  abstract = "In this study we examined morphological variation in two
              macrophyte species (Najas major All., N. marina L. and their
              hybrids) obtained from German fresh water systems. Clear-cut
              delimitation of these two taxa is notoriously difficult but
              important as they are used as indicator organisms for water
              quality within the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) and
              have recently been revealed as two genetically separate species.
              To reliably identify both taxa and their hybrids, we used an
              integrative approach testing six discrete and two ratio-based
              morphological leaf and seed characteristics against restriction
              fragment-length polymorphism patterns (RFLP) based on PCR of rDNA
              internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. Morphometric data of
              475 plant individuals from 25 different German lakes showed basic
              correlation with the species delimitation suggested by molecular
              data, but revealed considerable overlap for characteristic state
              ranges, which can lead to misidentification of species if a low
              number of observations is made on these traits. Hybrids showed a
              mosaic of both parental and intermediate morphological traits.
              Notably, the traditionally employed feature “number of teeth along
              the margin on the leaf sheaths” proved to be of low diagnostic
              value. Leaf dimensions, especially leaf widths, were shown to be
              more reliable characteristics for distinguishing parental taxa. In
              practice, further use of both Najas species within the
              implementation of the WFD should be accompanied by molecular
              genetic testing to detect both cryptic co-occurrence and
              hybridization. This study points out the importance of thorough
              sampling and molecular screening in widespread and taxonomically
              difficult groups.",

              Turkey, employing traditional morphological as well as molecular
              approaches (rbcL, ITS). Our fieldwork, herbarium studies and
              molecular analyses proved the existence of 22 taxa, of which 18
              belong to Potamogeton (including 4 interspecific hybrids), 3 to
              Stuckenia and 1 to monotypic Groenlandia. Morphological
              re-descriptions of the recognized taxa were prepared, and the
              information concerning their distribution in Turkey was refined,
              based on plant material from extensive fieldwork and on specimens
              stored in herbaria that were previously not examined.
              Additionally, new identification keys to genera and species, and
              distribution maps of the species were prepared. Phylogenetic
              relationships and intraspecific variations were assessed by
              including samples from other regions. The status of the
              Zannichelliaceae was investigated using nuclear and chloroplast
              DNA markers. Our results from ITS sequence divergence corroborate
              the separation of the two families noted by some authors, and are
              in accordance with the substantial morphological differences
              between them. Relatively large genetic distance and non-monophyly
              indicate that two genotypes of P. gramineus constitute cryptic
              species, for which the Turkish localities expand upon the
              previously known distribution areas. We identified P.
              schweinfurthii as a new species for Turkey and report P.
              ×angustifolius for the first time for this country. Weak
              morphological differentiation and high sequence similarity did not
              permit reliable differentiation between the closely related
              Stuckenia amblyphylla and S. filiformis.",
